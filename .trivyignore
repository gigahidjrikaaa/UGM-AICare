# Trivy Ignore File
# Use this file to suppress false positive vulnerability findings
# 
# Format: CVE-YYYY-NNNNN [optional comment]
# 
# Documentation: https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/configuration/filtering/

# Example: Suppress a specific CVE (uncomment and modify as needed)
# CVE-2024-12345  # False positive: We don't use the vulnerable code path

# Example: Suppress for a specific expiration date
# exp:2025-12-31 CVE-2024-12345  # Will be re-evaluated after this date

# =============================================================================
# Currently No Suppressions
# =============================================================================
# All detected vulnerabilities should be fixed via dependency updates
# Use this file only for documented false positives

# =============================================================================
# Common False Positive Patterns (examples - DO NOT uncomment without review)
# =============================================================================

# Development dependencies (if they're truly dev-only)
# CVE-2024-XXXXX  # black: only used in development, not in production

# Indirect dependencies that can't be fixed immediately
# CVE-2024-XXXXX  # transitive dependency from langchain, waiting for upstream fix

# Platform-specific vulnerabilities (if you're not on that platform)
# CVE-2024-XXXXX  # Windows-specific, we deploy on Linux only

# =============================================================================
# Process for Adding Suppressions
# =============================================================================
# 1. Verify the CVE is truly a false positive
# 2. Document WHY it's not exploitable in your context
# 3. Add with clear comment and optional expiration
# 4. Get review from security-conscious team member
# 5. Commit with detailed explanation in commit message
