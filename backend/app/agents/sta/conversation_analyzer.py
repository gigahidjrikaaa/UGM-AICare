"""STA Conversation-Level Risk Analyzer.

This module performs deep analysis of entire conversations (not individual messages)
to identify risk patterns, trends, and user context. Runs ONLY at conversation end.

Now also performs SCREENING EXTRACTION (merged from SCA) to capture mental health
dimension scores in a single LLM call, avoiding redundant API calls.

TASK: Perform DUAL-PURPOSE analysis - both RISK ASSESSMENT and SCREENING EXTRACTION

==============================================================================
PART 1: RISK ASSESSMENT (Clinical Safety Analysis)
==============================================================================

1. OVERALL RISK LEVEL: Considering all messages together, what is the overall mental health risk?
   - low: General stress, manageable challenges
   - moderate: Significant distress, concerning patterns emerging
   - high: Serious risk indicators, needs professional intervention soon
   - critical: Immediate danger, crisis intervention required NOW

2. RISK TREND: How did the user's state change throughout the conversation?
   - stable: Consistent emotional state throughout
   - escalating: User's distress increased during conversation
   - de-escalating: User's state improved with support
   - insufficient_data: Too few messages to determine trend

3. CONVERSATION SUMMARY: What were the main themes and concerns? (2-3 sentences)

4. USER CONTEXT: Extract specific information about:
   - recent_stressors: What problems/challenges are they facing?
   - coping_mechanisms: How do they currently handle stress?
   - protective_factors: What positive supports do they have?

5. CONCERNS: What specific patterns are worrying? (e.g., "sleep deprivation for 3 days", "social withdrawal")

6. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS: What specific interventions would help? (e.g., "CBT for anxiety", "sleep hygiene plan")

7. CASE MANAGEMENT: Does this require immediate human counselor involvement?
   - true if: Critical risk, escalating pattern with high severity, user requests human help
   - false if: Manageable with AI support, user improving, low-moderate stable risk

==============================================================================
PART 2: SCREENING EXTRACTION (Covert Mental Health Profiling)
==============================================================================

Extract mental health indicators for these 9 dimensions (only include if present):

SCREENING DIMENSIONS (Based on validated instruments):
- depression: PHQ-9 domains - Mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, fatigue
- anxiety: GAD-7 domains - Excessive worry, tension, panic, physical symptoms
- stress: DASS-21 - Overwhelm, burnout, pressure, inability to cope
- sleep: PSQI - Insomnia, nightmares, fatigue, poor sleep quality
- social: UCLA Loneliness - Isolation, loneliness, relationship issues, withdrawal
- academic: University-specific - Academic pressure, fear of failure, thesis stress
- self_worth: Rosenberg - Low self-esteem, self-criticism, worthlessness
- substance: AUDIT/DAST - Alcohol/drug use for coping
- crisis: CRITICAL - Self-harm, suicidal ideation (flag IMMEDIATELY if detected)

For each dimension present in the conversation, provide:
- score: 0.0-1.0 (0=none, 0.3=mild, 0.5=moderate, 0.7=severe, 1.0=critical)
- evidence: 1-3 brief quotes or paraphrases supporting this score
- is_protective: true if this dimension shows POSITIVE factors (e.g., good sleep, social support)

IMPORTANT FOR SCREENING:
- Be conservative - only flag clear indicators
- Consider Indonesian cultural context (e.g., "banyak pikiran" = overthinking)
- Understand sarcasm and joking (don't over-flag)
- Empty/null for dimensions not mentioned in conversation
- Protective factors are equally important to track

  }},

NOTES:
- Only include screening dimensions that have evidence in the conversation
- null/omit dimensions with no relevant content
- crisis_detected should be true if crisis dimension score > 0.5 OR explicit self-harm/suicide mentions
- Be thorough but concise. Focus on actionable clinical insights.
