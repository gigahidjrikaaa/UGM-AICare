"""Models package for UGM-AICare backend.

Core/Shared Models Only
========================

This module contains only core models used across all domains:
- User authentication and authorization
- Revenue reporting (shared finance model)
- System administration and infrastructure
- Social features (tweets, badges)
- LangGraph tracking and monitoring

Domain-specific models have been migrated:
- Mental Health: app.domains.mental_health.models
- Finance: app.domains.finance.models
- Blockchain: app.domains.blockchain.models

Always import from domain modules directly:
    from app.domains.mental_health.models import Conversation, JournalEntry
