"""Shared role normalization utilities.

The system has four canonical roles:

    admin        full administrative access (read + write on all admin routes)
    counselor    elevated access for counselors (case management, clinical views)
    user         any authenticated app user (students, lecturers, staff)
    admin_viewer read-only admin access for demo and auditors

Legacy aliases that may still exist in the database or arrive from older
frontend builds are silently resolved to their canonical equivalents:

    "therapist"                          → counselor  (renamed, no longer distinct)
    "student"                            → user       (renamed; lecturers also use the app)
    "administrator" / "superadmin" /
    "super-admin"                        → admin

All functions here are pure — no side effects, no I/O — and safe to call on
every authenticated request.
