Mental Health Domain Routes

This module aggregates all mental health-related routes for the UGM-AICare platform.
All routes are organized by feature area and can be imported from this single location.

Route Categories:
- Core: chat, feedback, session_events, summary
- Journaling: journal, journal_prompts
- Clinical: appointments, counselor, intervention_plans, clinical_analytics_routes
- AI Agents: agents, agents_command, agents_graph, safety_triage, langgraph, langgraph_analytics
- Features: quests, surveys

Note: CBT modules have been deprecated and integrated into SCA (Support Coach Agent).
See app/agents/sca/ for CBT-based intervention plans (cognitive_restructuring, behavioral_activation).
