    "## 4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has executed a suite of evaluations targeting the core components of the UGM-AICare agentic framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **RQ1 (Safety):** The evaluation of the Safety Triage Agent provides quantitative metrics on its ability to detect crises. The False Negative Rate is the most critical indicator of its real-world safety.\n",
    "*   **RQ2 (Orchestration):** The State Transition Accuracy for the Aika Meta-Agent measures the fundamental reliability of the system's routing logic.\n",
    "*   **RQ3 (Quality & Privacy):** The evaluation of the TCA's coaching quality and the IA's privacy compliance provides insight into the framework's ability to generate outputs that are both useful and responsible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collective findings from these tests may offer substantial evidence regarding the framework's viability, robustness, and safety. These results can be directly used to support the conclusions of the thesis, highlighting both the strengths and potential limitations of the proposed agentic model for mental health support. Any failures or low scores observed during this evaluation should be interpreted as areas requiring further research and development."

    "2.  Simulate each conversation by sending messages to the Aika orchestrator's `/v1/chat/aika` endpoint.\n",
    "3.  At each turn, compare the agent's actual output (intent, risk, next agent) with the expected values from the dataset.\n",

High accuracy in this test is critical, as it demonstrates the core reliability and predictability of the agentic framework's central nervous system.
