# UGM-AICare Backend

FastAPI service that powers the Safety Agent Suite behind UGM-AICare. The backend orchestrates crisis detection, CBT-informed coaching, clinical case management, and privacy-preserving analytics for university mental health support. Google Gemini 2.5 API provides empathetic conversations and evidence-based interventions through LangGraph-orchestrated agents.

## Safety Agent Suite

| Agent | Scope | Highlights | Status (Sep 2025) |
|-------|-------|------------|--------------------|
| 🛡️ **Safety Triage Agent (STA)** | Real-time risk scoring inside the chat flow | Crisis banner orchestration, feature flags, professional referral, audit logging | API scaffolding in progress |
| � **Support Coach Agent (SCA)** | CBT-informed coaching and micro-interventions | Empathetic dialogue, structured self-help modules, therapeutic exercises, progress tracking | Core pipeline implemented |
| 🗂️ **Service Desk Agent (SDA)** | Operational command center for clinical staff | Case timelines, SLA monitoring, escalation workflows, clinical assignment | Data model defined, routes pending |
| 🔍 **Insights Agent (IA)** | Privacy-preserving analytics over anonymized events | Differential privacy budgets (ε-δ), k-anonymity, aggregate trend analysis | Migration drafted, query layer pending |

Refer to `PROJECT_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` for the canonical roadmap and alignment guidance.

## Tech Stack & Integrations

- **Runtime:** Python 3.11+ with FastAPI, asynchronous SQLAlchemy, and LangChain
- **Data Layer:** PostgreSQL, Redis (session state + feature flags), deterministic hashing for privacy
- **LLM Providers:** Google Gemini (hosted) and optional Gemma 3 runtime wired through `core/llm.py`
- **Authentication & Sessions:** JWT validation, NextAuth sync endpoints, Redis for sessions
- **Messaging & Tasks:** Redis queues, APScheduler for background tasks, email/SMS connectors
- **Feature Flags & Config:** Runtime toggles for STA/SCA/SDA/IA activation and environment-driven configs
- **Observability:** Structured logging (JSON), Prometheus instrumentation, optional Sentry integration
- **Security:** JWT auth, parameterised queries, configurable CORS, consent & redaction guardrails

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Redis 6+ (recommended for production; local dev can fall back to in-memory cache)
- (Optional) Local Gemma 3 text-generation service reachable over HTTP

---

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gigahidjrikaaa/UGM-AICare.git
   cd UGM-AICare/backend
   ```

2. **Create an isolated environment** (recommended path: `.venv` in repo root)

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   # macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Provision environment variables**
   - Copy `env.example` (root) or craft a dedicated `backend/.env`.
   - Populate the following minimum set (see `app/utils/env_check.py` for the full list):

     | Category | Key | Notes |
     |----------|-----|-------|
     | Database | `DATABASE_URL`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB` | Use async URL (`postgresql+asyncpg://...`) for runtime |
     | Redis | `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT` | Include `REDIS_USERNAME`/`REDIS_PASSWORD` if your instance requires auth |
     | Auth | `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `INTERNAL_API_KEY` | Keep secrets out of version control |
     | App URLs | `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `BACKEND_URL` | Comma-separated origins for CORS |
     | Email | `EMAIL_USERNAME`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER`, `EMAIL_SMTP_PORT` | Needed for outreach + crisis alerts |

   | LLM | `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY` | Required for Gemini access; update the Gemma service URL in `app/core/llm.py` if you host a local runtime |
     | Blockchain (optional) | `EDU_TESTNET_RPC_URL`, `NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`, `BACKEND_MINTER_PRIVATE_KEY` | Required only if on-chain rewards are enabled |
     | Social (optional) | `TWITTER_*` keys | Needed for campaign connectors |
     | Runtime | `APP_ENV`, `PORT` | `APP_ENV=development` for local work |

   - Never commit populated `.env` files; use `scripts/reset_db.py` and `app/utils/env_check.py` to validate configuration locally.

5. **Prepare the database schema**

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

6. **(Optional) Seed sample data**

   ```bash
   python reset_db.py --with-sample-data
   ```

---

## Running the Service

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

- API root: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>
- Interactive docs (Swagger): <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>
- Redoc reference: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc>

During development, run `python -m app.utils.env_check` (or import `check_env()`) to confirm required variables before launching.

---

## Quality Gates

- **Unit & async tests**

  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

- **Static analysis (optional but recommended)**

  ```bash
  black app tests
  isort app tests
  flake8 app tests
  ```

Ensure tests cover new Safety Agent flows (STA/SCA/SDA/IA) before enabling related feature flags.

---

## Operational Notes

- **Migrations:** Alembic revisions live inside `alembic/versions/`. Follow the schema rollout sequence defined in `PROJECT_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` (Database → Agents → Frontend → Playbooks).
- **Feature Flags:** STA feature rollout is guarded via configuration; keep defaults off until clinical review signs off.
- **LangGraph Orchestration:** All agent coordination handled through LangGraph's stateful graph-based controller. Agent routing specifications defined in `app/agents/safety_graph_specs.py`.
- **Monitoring:** `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator` exposes metrics under `/metrics`; integrate with your Prometheus/Grafana stack. Configure `SENTRY_DSN` to enable error tracing.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Checks |
|---------|--------|
| Missing environment variables | Run `check_env()` from `app/utils/env_check.py`; ensure `.env` is loaded (use `python-dotenv` or export manually). |
| Database connection errors | Verify PostgreSQL is running, confirm async URL uses `postgresql+asyncpg://`, rerun migrations. |
| Redis unreachable | Ensure Redis server is accessible; for local dev you can set `REDIS_HOST=localhost` and start a local instance. The app falls back to in-memory cache but disables queue-backed features. |
| Gemini API failures | Confirm `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY`, project access, and region; inspect logged safety block reasons. |
| LangGraph orchestration errors | Check agent graph specifications in `app/agents/safety_graph_specs.py` and validate node/edge configurations in logs. |
