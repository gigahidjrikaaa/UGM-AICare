# Deprecated: AI Integration Guide

This document described the legacy dual-provider LLM routing that powered the original analytics/intervention stack. The Safety Agent refactor replaces those flows with new STA/SCA/SDA/IA integrations.

Refer to `single-source-of-truth.md` for the current architecture summary and track implementation details in `refactor_plan.md` until the refreshed AI integration notes are published.
