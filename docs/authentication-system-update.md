# Deprecated: Authentication System Update

Authentication changes for the legacy admin dashboards are superseded by the Safety Agent RBAC initiative. Active work now lives alongside the new `core/rbac.py` module and related FastAPI dependencies.

Follow the notes in `refactor_plan.md` and upcoming RBAC documentation rather than this legacy update summary.
