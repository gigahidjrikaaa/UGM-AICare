## 🔥 Deflationary Mechanisms

### 1. Redemption Burns (Primary)

```
All real-world purchases = 100% burn

Vouchers ............ 10M CARE/year (Year 2)
Event Tickets ....... 2M CARE/year
Merch/Products ...... 5M CARE/year
Premium Features .... 3M CARE/year
Clinical Services ... 1M CARE/year
────────────────────────────────────
Total Annual Burn ... ~21M CARE/year
```

### 2. Treasury Buyback

```
25% of platform revenue → CARE buyback → 100% burn

Year 2 Estimate:
Platform Revenue .... $2M USD
Buyback Budget ...... $500K (25%)
At $0.05/CARE ....... 10M CARE burned
```

### 3. Staking Lockup (Pseudo-Deflation)

```
Estimated 40% of supply staked by Year 2

Circulating: 437M
Staked: -175M (40%)
────────────────────
Actively Trading: 262M (60%)
```

**Net Effect**: By Year 5, near-zero inflation (<1% after all burns)
