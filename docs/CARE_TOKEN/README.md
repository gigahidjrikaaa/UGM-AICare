## 📊 Key Tokenomics Summary

### Distribution (Version A - Approved)

```
Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 CARE (100%)

Community ........ 35% (350M) - Airdrops, Staking, Governance
Wellness ......... 20% (200M) - Mental health rewards
Team ............. 13% (130M) - 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff
Partners ......... 10% (100M) - 2-year vesting, merchant/clinical
Treasury ......... 10% (100M) - Operations + buyback
Liquidity ........ 8% (80M) - DEX pools, 24-month lock
Grants ........... 4% (40M) - Research + developer ecosystem
```

### Key Metrics

- **TGE Unlock**: 12.5% (125M CARE)
- **Year 1 Circulation**: 24.3% (243M CARE)
- **Staking Target**: 40-50% of supply
- **Burn Rate**: 3-5% annually (Years 2-5)
- **Team Lock**: 4 years (0% at TGE)
- **Liquidity Lock**: 2 years (prevents rug pull)
