## 💎 Detailed Category Breakdown

### 1. Community (35% = 350M CARE)

**Purpose**: Drive decentralization, reward early adopters, and establish long-term holder base

### 2. Wellness (20% = 200M CARE)

**Purpose**: Reward mental health engagement and incentivize therapeutic activities

| Sub-Category | Allocation | Tokens | Distribution Method | Annual Cap |
|--------------|-----------|--------|---------------------|------------|
| **CBT & Therapy Modules** | 10% | 100,000,000 | On completion | 25M/year |
| → CBT Module Completion | 5% | 50,000,000 | Per module | 12.5M/year |
| → Guided Meditation Sessions | 2% | 20,000,000 | Per 10 sessions | 5M/year |
| → Therapy Milestones | 2% | 20,000,000 | On milestone | 5M/year |
| → Group Therapy Participation | 1% | 10,000,000 | Per session | 2.5M/year |
| **Daily Engagement** | 7% | 70,000,000 | Daily claims | 17.5M/year |
| → Daily Check-ins | 3% | 30,000,000 | Daily streak | 7.5M/year |
| → Mood Tracking (7-day) | 2% | 20,000,000 | Per week | 5M/year |
| → Journaling Activities | 1.5% | 15,000,000 | Per entry | 3.75M/year |

| → 30-Day Consistency | 1% | 10,000,000 | On milestone | 2.5M/year |
| → 90-Day Recovery Path | 1% | 10,000,000 | On milestone | 2.5M/year |
| → Counselor-Verified Progress | 1% | 10,000,000 | On verification | 2.5M/year |

**Reward Schedule (Halving Model)**:

| Period | Base Reward/Activity | Total Annual Distribution | Inflation Rate |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Year 1** | 100 CARE | 50,000,000 CARE | 5.0% |
| **Year 2** | 50 CARE | 25,000,000 CARE | 2.5% |
| **Year 3** | 25 CARE | 12,500,000 CARE | 1.25% |
| **Year 4+** | 12.5 CARE | 6,250,000 CARE | 0.625% |

**Example Calculations**:

- Complete CBT module: 100 CARE (Year 1) → 50 CARE (Year 2) → 25 CARE (Year 3)
- Daily check-in streak (30 days): 3,000 CARE (Year 1) → 1,500 CARE (Year 2)
- Full recovery milestone: 5,000 CARE (Year 1) → 2,500 CARE (Year 2)

**Inflation Control**:

- Halving every year reduces long-term inflation
- Annual caps prevent excessive minting (max 50M in Year 1, 25M in Year 2, etc.)
- By Year 4, wellness rewards contribute <1% inflation
- Estimated 4-year distribution: ~94M tokens (47% of pool), leaving 106M for Years 5-10+

**Strategic Rationale**: Generous early rewards drive adoption, while halving ensures long-term sustainability and creates urgency for early participation.

**Vesting Model**: **Standard 4-Year Cliff Vesting (Team Standard)**

```
CORE TEAM (Developers, Business, Marketing):
├── Total Vesting: 48 months (4 years)
├── Cliff Period: 12 months (no tokens released)
├── Release Schedule: Monthly linear after cliff
├── Monthly Release: 1/48th of allocation after month 12
└── Example: 60M tokens → 0 in Year 1 → 15M/year in Years 2-5

ADVISORS (Clinical, Tech, Strategy):
├── Total Vesting: 24 months (2 years)
├── Cliff Period: 6 months
├── Release Schedule: Monthly linear after cliff
├── Monthly Release: 1/24th of allocation after month 6
└── Example: 30M tokens → 0 in Month 1-6 → 1.25M/month in Months 7-30
```

**Vesting Enforcement**:

- Smart contract-based vesting (CareTeamVesting.sol)
- Non-transferable during cliff period
- Linear unlock formula: `unlocked = (total * (now - start - cliff)) / (duration - cliff)`
- Revocable by DAO governance in case of misconduct

**Release Schedule Example (100,000 CARE allocation)**:

| Month | Cumulative Unlocked | Available to Claim | % of Total |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|
| 0-12 | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| 13 | 2,083 | 2,083 | 2.08% |
| 18 | 12,500 | 12,500 | 12.5% |
| 24 | 25,000 | 25,000 | 25% |
| 36 | 50,000 | 50,000 | 50% |
| 48 | 100,000 | 100,000 | 100% |
| 60 | 100,000 | 100,000 | 100% |

**Strategic Rationale**:

- **1-year cliff prevents early exits**: Team can't leave immediately with tokens
- **4-year vesting aligns long-term**: Incentivizes 4+ year commitment
- **Advisor 2-year vesting**: Shorter commitment for advisory roles
- **0% TGE unlock**: Builds trust with community (team earns tokens, not given upfront)

- **Year 1**: Controlled release (24.3% circulating) prevents oversupply
- **Year 2**: Peak unlock year (43.7% total) due to team vesting completion
- **Year 3-5**: Declining inflation as wellness rewards halve and vesting completes
- **Year 5+**: <10% inflation annually, primarily from wellness and community

### Inflation Rate Analysis

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 | Long-term |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Annual Unlock** | 243M | 194M | 176.5M | 119.25M | 82.25M | <50M |
| **Inflation Rate** | 24.3% | 19.4% | 17.6% | 11.9% | 8.2% | <5% |
| **Circulating Supply** | 243M | 437M | 613.5M | 732.75M | 815M | ~950M |
| **Staked (Est.)** | 50M | 150M | 250M | 300M | 350M | 400M+ |
| **Effective Circulation** | 193M | 287M | 363.5M | 432.75M | 465M | ~550M |
| **Effective Inflation** | 19.3% | 9.4% | 7.6% | 6.9% | 3.2% | <2% |

**Deflationary Counterbalances**:

- Redemption burns: -5M to -15M CARE/year (Years 2-5)
- Buyback burns: -3M to -10M CARE/year (from Treasury)
- Feature unlock burns: -1M to -3M CARE/year
- **Net Inflation**: ~10-15% (Year 2) → ~5% (Year 3) → ~2% (Year 5+)

## 🔥 Deflationary Mechanisms

### 1. Redemption Burns (Primary Deflation)

All tokens redeemed for real-world value are **permanently burned**:

| Redemption Type | Burn Rate | Estimated Annual Volume (Year 2) | Annual Burn |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Voucher Purchases | 100% | 10M CARE | 10M CARE |
| Event Tickets | 100% | 2M CARE | 2M CARE |
| Merch/Products | 100% | 5M CARE | 5M CARE |
| Premium Features | 100% | 3M CARE | 3M CARE |
| Clinical Services | 100% | 1M CARE | 1M CARE |
| **Total Annual Burn** | - | **21M CARE** | **21M CARE** |

**Economic Impact** (Year 2):

- New issuance: 194M CARE
- Redemption burn: -21M CARE
- **Net supply increase**: 173M CARE (8.65% inflation vs 19.4% without burns)

### 2. Treasury Buyback & Burn

**Revenue Allocation Model**:

```
Platform Revenue Sources:
├── Premium Subscriptions: 30% of revenue
├── Clinical Partner Fees: 25% of revenue
├── Merchant Transaction Fees: 20% of revenue
├── Enterprise Licensing: 15% of revenue
└── Grants & Donations: 10% of revenue

Buyback Allocation:
├── 25% of net revenue → CARE buyback
├── 100% of bought CARE → Burned permanently
└── Quarterly buyback events (transparent, pre-announced)
```

**Example Scenario** (Year 2):

- Platform revenue: $2M USD
- Buyback allocation: $500K (25%)
- CARE price: $0.05
- Tokens bought & burned: 10M CARE
- **Additional deflation**: -10M CARE

### 3. Staking Lockup (Pseudo-Deflation)

While not burned, staked tokens are **removed from circulation**:

| Stake Duration | APY | Expected Stake Rate | Year 2 Staked | Effective Burn |
|----------------|-----|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| 30 days | 5% | 10% | 43.7M | 43.7M |
| 90 days | 12% | 15% | 65.6M | 65.6M |
| 180 days | 20% | 10% | 43.7M | 43.7M |
| 365 days | 35% | 5% | 21.9M | 21.9M |
| **Total** | - | **40%** | **174.9M** | **174.9M** |

**Net Circulating Supply** (Year 2):

- Total supply: 437M
- Staked: -174.9M (40%)
- **Actively trading**: 262.1M (60%)

### 4. Combined Deflationary Effect

| Year | Issuance | Redemption Burn | Buyback Burn | Net Inflation | Staked % | Effective Circulation |
|------|----------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | 243M | -5M | -2M | +236M | 20% | 189M |
| 2 | 194M | -21M | -10M | +163M | 40% | 262M |
| 3 | 176.5M | -35M | -18M | +123.5M | 45% | 338M |
| 4 | 119.25M | -45M | -22M | +52.25M | 45% | 375M |
| 5 | 82.25M | -50M | -25M | +7.25M | 50% | 411M |

**Long-Term Trajectory**:

- By Year 4: Net inflation drops to **<5%** (from >20% in Year 1)
- By Year 5: Near-zero inflation (**<1%** after burns)
- By Year 7+: **Deflationary** (burns > issuance)

## 📋 Appendix

### A. Glossary

- **TGE (Token Generation Event)**: Initial deployment and distribution of tokens
- **Cliff Period**: Time during which no vested tokens can be claimed
- **Linear Vesting**: Tokens unlock gradually in equal amounts over time
- **APY (Annual Percentage Yield)**: Return on staked tokens per year
- **Circulating Supply**: Tokens available for trading (excludes locked/vested)
- **Max Supply**: Hard cap on total tokens that can ever exist (1 billion)
- **Burn**: Permanent removal of tokens from supply
- **Multi-sig**: Wallet requiring multiple signatures for transactions
- **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**: Community-governed entity

### B. Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Team Member Vesting**

```
Allocation: 10,000,000 CARE
Vesting: 48 months linear, 12-month cliff
Start Date: October 27, 2025

Timeline:
- Oct 2025 - Oct 2026 (Month 0-12): 0 CARE unlocked (cliff)
- Nov 2026 (Month 13): 208,333 CARE unlocked (10M / 48)
- Dec 2026 (Month 14): 208,333 CARE unlocked
- ... (continues monthly)
- Oct 2029 (Month 48): Final 208,333 CARE unlocked
- Total Unlocked: 10,000,000 CARE
```

**Example 2: Staking Rewards**

```
Stake Amount: 100,000 CARE
Duration: 365 days
APY: 35%
Start Date: January 1, 2026

Calculation:
- Daily Rate: 35% / 365 = 0.0959% per day
- Daily Reward: 100,000 * 0.000959 = 95.9 CARE/day
- Annual Reward: 95.9 * 365 = 35,000 CARE
- Total After 1 Year: 100,000 + 35,000 = 135,000 CARE

Note: Rewards compound if re-staked
```

**Example 3: Redemption at Merchant**

```
Item: UGM Hoodie
Cash Price: 200,000 IDR ($13 USD)
CARE Discount: 10%
CARE Price: $0.05

CARE Payment Calculation:
- Discounted Price: $13 * 0.9 = $11.70
- CARE Required: $11.70 / $0.05 = 234 CARE
- User Savings: $1.30 (10%)
- Merchant Receives: 234 CARE (can sell for $11.70)
- Tokens Burned: 234 CARE (deflationary!)
```
