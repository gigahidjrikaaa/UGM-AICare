## Technical Highlights

### Mudarabah Model

**Structure:**

```bash
Rabbul Mal (Stakers)  ‚Üí  Provide CARE tokens as capital
        ‚Üì
Mudarib (Platform)    ‚Üí  Manages staking operations
        ‚Üì
Platform Revenue      ‚Üí  Wellness fees, subscriptions, NFTs, partners
        ‚Üì
Net Profit            ‚Üí  Revenue - Expenses
        ‚Üì
Wakala Fee (10%)      ‚Üí  Platform agency fee
        ‚Üì
Distributable Profit  ‚Üí  90% to stakers
        ‚Üì
Tier-Based Split      ‚Üí  Bronze 60%, Silver 70%, Gold 80%, Platinum 90%
        ‚Üì
User Rewards          ‚Üí  Based on stake proportion in tier
```

**Example Calculation:**

```bash
Month 1: Platform earns $30K revenue, spends $15K
Net Profit: $15K
Wakala Fee: $1.5K (10%)
Distributable: $13.5K

Total Staked: 10M CARE
- Bronze: 5M CARE (50%) ‚Üí 60% profit share ‚Üí $4,050
- Silver: 3M CARE (30%) ‚Üí 70% profit share ‚Üí $2,835
- Gold: 1.5M CARE (15%) ‚Üí 80% profit share ‚Üí $1,620
- Platinum: 0.5M CARE (5%) ‚Üí 90% profit share ‚Üí $607.50

Bronze User (10K CARE = 0.2% of Bronze pool):
- Share: $4,050 √ó 0.2% = $8.10 = 810 CARE (at $0.01)

Platinum User (100K CARE = 20% of Platinum pool):
- Share: $607.50 √ó 20% = $121.50 = 12,150 CARE (at $0.01)
```

### Revenue Sources (Halal)

1. **CareWellness Transaction Fees** (40% of revenue)
   - Users pay 0.1 CARE per activity verification
   - Example: 100K activities/month = 10K CARE

2. **Premium Subscriptions** (30% of revenue)
   - Advanced AI coaching: $5/month
   - Example: 1,000 subscribers = $5K/month

3. **NFT Badge Sales** (20% of revenue)
   - Mental health achievement NFTs
   - Example: 500 badges √ó $10 = $5K/month

4. **Partner Integration Fees** (10% of revenue)
   - Universities/therapy centers
   - Example: 5 partners √ó $2K = $10K/month

5. **Treasury Investment Returns** (<1% of revenue)
   - Halal investments only (Sukuk, Sharia-compliant stocks)
   - Example: $100K treasury √ó 5% = $417/month

**Total Monthly Revenue (Projected):** ~$30K (~3M CARE at $0.01)

### Oracle Workflow

```bash
Day 1 (00:00): Finance team submits monthly report
               ‚îî‚îÄ> submitMonthlyReport(month, revenue, expenses, breakdown)

Day 1-2:       Finance team approves (requires 3-of-5)
               ‚îî‚îÄ> Approver 1: approveReport(month) ‚Üí 1/3
               ‚îî‚îÄ> Approver 2: approveReport(month) ‚Üí 2/3
               ‚îî‚îÄ> Approver 3: approveReport(month) ‚Üí 3/3 ‚úÖ

Day 1-3:       48-hour challenge period
               ‚îî‚îÄ> Auditors review financial data
               ‚îî‚îÄ> If suspicious: challengeReport(month, reason)

Day 3 (48:00): Challenge period ends
               ‚îî‚îÄ> finalizeReport(month)
               ‚îî‚îÄ> CareStakingHalal.settleMonthlyProfit() triggered
               ‚îî‚îÄ> Profit distributed to stakers üéâ
```

## Migration Plan (From Old to New)

### Option 1: Hard Fork (Recommended)

**Deploy CareStakingHalal as separate contract:**

- Users migrate stakes from old CareStaking to new CareStakingHalal
- Old contract frozen (no new stakes)
- 60-day migration period
- Unclaimed APY rewards from old contract can still be claimed

**Pros:**

- Clean separation
- Clear messaging: "We're now Sharia-compliant"
- No code pollution

**Cons:**

- User friction (manual migration)
- Two contracts during transition

### Option 2: Coexistence (Not Recommended)

**Deploy both contracts:**

- Users choose which system to use
- Original CareStaking for non-Muslim users
- CareStakingHalal for Muslim users and ethical investors

**Pros:**

- No forced migration
- User choice

**Cons:**

- Two systems to maintain long-term
- Splits liquidity and governance power
- Confusing messaging

**Recommendation:** **Option 1 (Hard Fork with 60-day transition)**
