## üîê Security Features by Priority

### Tier 1: Critical (Implemented) ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Mitigations

### 1. Owner Centralization (Medium Risk)

**Current:** Owner has unilateral power in all contracts  
**Mitigation:**

- ‚úÖ Use multi-sig wallet (Gnosis Safe 3-of-5)
- ‚è≥ Transfer ownership to DAO (Phase 3)
- ‚è≥ Implement timelock (24-48 hours for critical actions)

### 2. Bonus Subjectivity (Medium Risk)

**Current:** Owner determines partner tier upgrades  
**Mitigation:**

- ‚úÖ Document bonus criteria in legal agreements
- ‚è≥ Implement oracle-based metrics (Phase 2)
- ‚è≥ Publish tier upgrade announcements

### 3. Gas Optimization (Low Risk)

**Current:** Some view functions loop through arrays  
**Mitigation:**

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Use off-chain indexing (The Graph, Subsquid)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Acceptable for infrequent calls
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Does not affect security
