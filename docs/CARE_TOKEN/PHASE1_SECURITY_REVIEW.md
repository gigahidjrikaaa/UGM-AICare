---

## Security Assessment

### ✅ Strengths

#### 1. OpenZeppelin Standards

- **All contracts use audited OpenZeppelin libraries**
  - `SafeERC20` prevents token transfer issues
  - `ReentrancyGuard` prevents reentrancy attacks
  - `AccessControl` for role-based permissions
  - `Ownable` for ownership management

#### 2. Immutable Critical Parameters

- **CareTeamVesting:** `careToken`, `vestingStartTime` are immutable
- **CarePartnerVesting:** `careToken`, `vestingStartTime` are immutable
- **CareLiquidityLock:** `careToken` is immutable
- **CareTokenController:** `careToken` is immutable
- **Impact:** Prevents manipulation of core contract parameters

#### 3. Reentrancy Protection

- All external functions that transfer tokens use `nonReentrant` modifier
- Token transfers occur at the end of functions (checks-effects-interactions pattern)
- No external calls before state updates

#### 4. Integer Overflow Protection

- Solidity 0.8.28 has built-in overflow/underflow checks
- All arithmetic operations are safe by default
- No unsafe casts or unchecked blocks (except where explicitly safe)

#### 5. Access Control

- **CareTeamVesting:** Only owner can add beneficiaries and revoke vesting
- **CarePartnerVesting:** Only owner can add partners and award bonuses
- **CareLiquidityLock:** Only owner can withdraw, requires 2-sig for emergency unlock
- **CareTokenController:** Role-based minting prevents unauthorized token issuance

#### 6. Cap Enforcement

- **CareTeamVesting:** Cannot exceed 130M CARE allocation
- **CarePartnerVesting:** Base + bonus cannot exceed 100M CARE
- **CareLiquidityLock:** Cannot exceed 80M CARE allocation
- **CareTokenController:** Each category has enforced caps (totals 1B CARE)

#### 7. Transparency

- All significant actions emit events for off-chain tracking
- Detailed view functions for audit and monitoring
- Per-category and per-beneficiary tracking

---

## Security Features by Contract

### CareTeamVesting.sol

#### ✅ Security Features

1. **Cliff Enforcement**
   - No tokens can be claimed before cliff period ends
   - Prevents premature withdrawals

2. **Linear Vesting**
   - Fair distribution over time (4 years for team, 2 years for advisors)
   - Prevents large single withdrawals

3. **Revocation Mechanism**
   - Owner can revoke vesting for terminated team members
   - Unvested tokens returned to owner
   - Already claimed tokens remain with beneficiary

4. **Anti-Double-Spend**
   - Beneficiary can only be added once
   - Claimed amount tracking prevents double claims

5. **View-Only Balance Queries**
   - `vestedAmount()` and `claimableAmount()` are view functions
   - Safe for off-chain queries without gas costs

#### ⚠️ Considerations

1. **Owner Trust**
   - Owner has unilateral revocation power
   - **Mitigation:** Use multi-sig wallet as owner
   - **Recommendation:** Transfer ownership to DAO after TGE

2. **No Transfer of Vesting Rights**
   - Beneficiaries cannot transfer their vesting allocation
   - **Status:** This is intentional design (locks team members)

3. **Gas Costs for Many Beneficiaries**
   - `getVestingStats()` loops through all beneficiaries
   - **Mitigation:** Use pagination if >100 beneficiaries
   - **Status:** Acceptable for expected 20-30 team members

---

### CarePartnerVesting.sol

#### ✅ Security Features

1. **Tiered Cliff Periods**
   - Premium: 3 months, Standard: 4 months, Basic: 6 months
   - Graduated risk based on partner tier

2. **Performance Bonus Caps**
   - Bronze: 5%, Silver: 10%, Gold: 20%
   - Total bonus pool cannot exceed remaining allocation

3. **One-Way Tier Upgrades**
   - Performance and service tiers can only increase
   - Prevents owner from downgrading partners maliciously

4. **Separate Bonus Tracking**
   - Base allocation tracked separately from bonuses
   - Clear audit trail for bonus awards

#### ⚠️ Considerations

1. **Subjective Bonus Awards**
   - Owner determines performance/service tier upgrades
   - **Mitigation:** Document bonus criteria off-chain
   - **Recommendation:** Implement oracle-based metrics (Phase 2)

2. **Bonus Inflation Risk**
   - If all partners achieve Gold + Premium, bonus pool = 35% of base
   - **Mitigation:** Contract enforces `totalBonusAllocated <= MAX - totalBaseAllocated`
   - **Status:** Safe, bonus pool is within 100M cap

3. **Complex State Management**
   - 10 state variables per partner
   - **Mitigation:** IR optimizer enabled (`viaIR: true`)
   - **Status:** Compiles successfully, gas costs acceptable

---

### CareLiquidityLock.sol

#### ✅ Security Features

1. **24-Month Hard Lock**
   - No withdrawals possible for 2 years
   - Prevents early rug pulls

2. **Two-Signature Emergency Unlock**
   - Requires owner + authorized signer
   - Uses ECDSA signature verification
   - Prevents unilateral emergency actions

3. **Per-Pool Isolation**
   - Each liquidity pool tracked independently
   - Cross-pool contamination impossible

4. **Signature Replay Protection**
   - Signature includes `poolId`, `chainId`, `contract address`
   - Cannot replay signatures across pools or chains

5. **Time-Based Unlock Schedule**
   - Linear unlock over 6 months after lock period
   - Fair gradual liquidity release

#### ⚠️ Considerations

1. **Emergency Unlock Risk**
   - Owner + authorizer can unlock at any time
   - **Mitigation:** Use multi-sig wallets for both roles
   - **Recommendation:** Set authorizer to 3-of-5 multi-sig

2. **Signature Security**
   - ECDSA signature verification in `recoverSigner()`
   - **Status:** Standard implementation, well-tested
   - **Note:** Requires off-chain signing infrastructure

3. **No Partial Emergency Unlock**
   - Emergency unlock releases entire pool
   - **Status:** Intentional design (emergency only)
   - **Recommendation:** Document emergency procedures

---

### CareTokenController.sol

#### ✅ Security Features

1. **Category-Based Mint Caps**
   - 14 categories with individual caps
   - Total caps = 1B CARE (matches max supply)
   - Prevents category over-allocation

2. **Role-Based Minting**
   - 7 specialized roles (COMMUNITY_MINTER_ROLE, WELLNESS_MINTER_ROLE, etc.)
   - Each category requires specific role
   - Prevents unauthorized minting

3. **Burn Tracking**
   - 4 burn reasons: REDEMPTION, BUYBACK, PENALTY, MANUAL
   - Detailed statistics for deflationary metrics
   - Transparency for token supply analysis

4. **Category Status Toggle**
   - Admin can deactivate categories
   - Emergency stop mechanism per category

5. **Comprehensive Stats Functions**
   - `getCommunityStats()`, `getWellnessStats()`, `getBurnStats()`
   - Real-time monitoring of tokenomics

#### ⚠️ Considerations

1. **Role Management Complexity**
   - 7 roles + DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE
   - **Mitigation:** Document role assignment procedures
   - **Recommendation:** Use role hierarchy (admin > category managers)

2. **Burn Approval Flow**
   - Users must approve CareTokenController before burning
   - **Status:** Standard ERC20 pattern
   - **UX Note:** Frontend must handle approve + burn transactions

3. **No Category Transfer**
   - Once minted to a category, cannot change attribution
   - **Status:** Intentional for audit trail integrity

4. **Gas Costs for Total Calculations**
   - `getTotalMinted()` and `getTotalBurned()` loop through 14 categories
   - **Mitigation:** Use off-chain indexing for dashboards
   - **Status:** Acceptable for infrequent calls

---

## Cross-Contract Security Analysis

### Integration Points

1. **CareToken ↔ CareTokenController**
   - Controller must have MINTER_ROLE on CareToken
   - Controller enforces caps, CareToken enforces max supply
   - **Security:** Two-layer protection against over-minting

2. **CareToken ↔ Vesting Contracts**
   - Vesting contracts hold tokens, users claim from contracts
   - No direct minting by vesting contracts
   - **Security:** Vesting contracts must be funded upfront (transparent)

3. **CareToken ↔ CareLiquidityLock**
   - Lock contract holds tokens for liquidity pools
   - Time-based release prevents early withdrawal
   - **Security:** Tokens physically locked in contract

### Fund Flow Security

```
Initial Distribution:
CareToken.mint() → CareTokenController (with category caps)
                  ↓
         ┌────────┼────────┐
         ↓        ↓        ↓
  CareTeamVesting  CarePartnerVesting  CareLiquidityLock
     (130M)            (100M)              (80M)
         ↓        ↓        ↓
   Team Members   Partners   DEX Pools
   (after cliff) (after cliff) (after 24mo)
```

**Security:** Each layer enforces its own rules, no bypass possible

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Critical (None Found) ✅

No critical vulnerabilities identified.

### High (None Found) ✅

No high-severity issues identified.

### Medium (Addressed) ⚠️

#### 1. Owner Centralization

- **Issue:** Owner has significant power in all contracts
- **Risk:** Malicious owner could revoke vesting, emergency unlock
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use multi-sig wallet (recommended: Gnosis Safe 3-of-5)
  - Transfer ownership to DAO after TGE
  - Implement timelock (24-48 hours) for critical actions (Phase 3)
- **Status:** Acceptable for Phase 1, address in Phase 3

#### 2. Bonus Subjectivity (CarePartnerVesting)

- **Issue:** Owner determines performance/service tier upgrades
- **Risk:** Perceived unfairness or favoritism
- **Mitigation:**
  - Document bonus criteria in legal agreements
  - Publish tier upgrade announcements
  - Implement oracle-based metrics (Phase 2)
- **Status:** Acceptable with proper documentation

### Low (Noted) ℹ️

#### 1. Gas Optimization

- **Issue:** Some view functions loop through arrays (stats functions)
- **Impact:** Higher gas costs for large datasets
- **Mitigation:** Use off-chain indexing (The Graph, Subsquid)
- **Status:** Non-critical, does not affect security

#### 2. Front-Running Risk (Minor)

- **Issue:** Bonus awards visible in mempool before confirmation
- **Impact:** Partners might see upcoming tier upgrades early
- **Mitigation:** Not a security risk, just information disclosure
- **Status:** Acceptable, inherent to public blockchains
