## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### ✅ Confirmed Decisions

1. **MVP Scope:** Phase 1-2 (Foundation + Case Management) - CONFIRMED
2. **Real-Time Tech:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) for Phase 4 - Simple, effective
3. **Agent Integration:** Direct API calls + Event Bus (in-memory → Redis later)
4. **IA Storage:** Database table (`insights_reports`) - Queryable, reliable
5. **Phased Rollout:**
   - Sprint 1: Phase 1-2 (Foundation + Cases) - **ACTIVE**
   - Sprint 2: Phase 3-4 (Dashboard + Real-time)
   - Sprint 3: Phase 5 (Campaigns)
   - Sprint 4: Phase 6-7 (Settings + Hardening)

### ⏳ Pending Decisions

1. **Campaign Trigger DSL:** JSON structure vs Python expressions
2. **Email Service:** Current SMTP vs SendGrid/AWS SES
3. **Frontend Framework:** Next.js admin panel vs Existing UI
4. **Caching Strategy:** Redis configuration and cache keys
5. **Monitoring:** Application Insights vs Prometheus/Grafana

### Sprint 1: Foundation & Case Management (Current)

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For Developers

1. **Review Current State:**

   ```bash
   # Check database tables
   docker exec ugm_aicare_db psql -U giga -d aicare_db -c "\dt"
   
   # Check agent endpoints
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/agents/sta/classify
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/agents/sda/cases
   
   # Check admin dashboard
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/dashboard/overview
   ```

2. **Start Phase 1 Development:**

   ```bash
   # Create migration
   cd backend
   alembic revision -m "add_admin_infrastructure_tables"
   
   # Edit migration file (see Phase 1.1 tasks)
   # Run migration
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. **Test Changes:**

   ```bash
   # Run backend tests
   pytest backend/tests/
   
   # Check logs
   docker logs ugm_aicare_backend --tail 100
   ```

### For Project Managers

- **Current Focus:** Phase 1-2 (Foundation + Case Management)
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for Sprint 1
- **Deliverable:** Functional case management system for counselors
- **Blocker Check:** Review this document weekly, update task statuses

### For Counselors/Admins

- **What's Coming:** You'll soon have a complete command center to:
  - View all active cases in one place
  - See student conversations that triggered alerts (anonymized)
  - Assign cases to counselors
  - Track case resolution and SLA compliance
  - Monitor system-wide mental health trends

- **Timeline:** Initial features ready in ~3 weeks

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **No Real-Time Updates:** Dashboard requires manual refresh (Phase 4 will fix)
2. **IA Reports Not Stored:** Reports are generated but ephemeral (Phase 1 fixes)
3. **Manual Campaign Execution:** No automated triggers yet (Phase 5 adds this)
4. **Limited Case Filtering:** Basic filtering only (Phase 2 enhances)

### Technical Debt

1. Risk_factors column is `json` type, should be `jsonb` (performance)
2. No caching strategy for dashboard queries (Phase 7)
3. Agent health not monitored (Phase 6)

                                                                    ↓
                                                                EventBus → Broadcast
```

### Case Management Workflow (Phase 2)

```
Admin Dashboard → View Case List → Filter/Sort → Select Case → View Details
                                                              ↓
                                                    → View Conversation
                                                    → Assign Counselor
                                                    → Update Status
                                                    → Add Notes
```

### Campaign Trigger Flow (Phase 5)

```
IA Weekly Report → Store in DB → TriggerEvaluator → Check Conditions → Match Found → Execute Campaign
                                                                                    ↓
