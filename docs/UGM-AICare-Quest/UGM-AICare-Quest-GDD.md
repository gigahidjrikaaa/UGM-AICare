- Data Inputs: player mood trends, Harmony Score, guild status, academic calendar, safety flags.
- UX Elements: Quest HUD notification, Aika dialogue snippet framing the objective, difficulty tags, estimated time commitment, suggested companions (guildmates, mentors).
- Personalization: Aika references recent behavior (“You’ve been acing your journaling streak—ready to try a reflection quest tied to exam prep?”). Quests dynamically adapt (lighter tasks if streak broken, optional intensifiers for high Harmony players).
- Safety Layer: Content filtered through sentiment analysis; high-risk players receive supportive quests with counselor awareness.

**2. Action Execution & Support**

- Interaction Types:
  - In-app forms (mood logs, gratitude entries with journaling templates).
  - Guided experiences (breathing timers, CBT flashcards).
  - External verification (attend booked session → counselor confirms).
  - Social engagement (respond to peer post, join guild chat check-in).
- Assistive Features: Contextual tips, quick links to relevant resources, option to request live support. Timer/scheduler for longer tasks; progress saved mid-quest.
- Multiplayer Hooks: Shared tasks show live progress bars; guildmates can send boosts (e.g., encouragement emotes unlocking small `JOY` bonus).
- Accessibility: Multi-language content, audio narration toggle, low-stimulus mode for sensitive exercises.

**3. Reward Calculation & Feedback**

- Backend Flow: Quest service validates completion criteria → emits event to Rewards Calculator → applies multipliers (streak bonuses, guild buffs, sponsor boosts) → writes outcome to player profile and ledger.
- Reward Types:
  - XP for avatar level progression and skill unlocks.
  - `JOY` for cosmetic purchases and mini-games.
  - Harmony Score adjustments affecting narrative gating and guild rankings.
  - Potential `CARE` drops for high-impact or counselor-signed tasks.
- Feedback UI: Animated HUD update, toast notification with flavor text, audio chime tuned to quest category, optional share-to-guild button. Aika sends follow-up reflection or next-step suggestion.
- Transparency: Reward breakdown panel shows base reward vs. multipliers, with link to blockchain attestation when applicable.

**4. Resource Allocation & Upgrade Decisions**

- Player Choices:
  - Spend `JOY` on avatar cosmetics, temporary buffs, or mini-game entries.
  - Allocate `CARE` to Wellness Pools, guild upgrades, or governance staking.
  - Invest Harmony Score thresholds into unlocking story chapters or mentor workshops.
- UI Elements: Resource dashboard with projections (e.g., staking yield estimates), “Recommended next spend” tips, comparison view of guild upgrade benefits.
- Strategic Layer: Limited-time offers during events, diminishing returns for hoarding, opportunity cost prompts (“Contribute `CARE` to dorm pool to unlock shared resilience aura?”).

**5. World Impact & Escalation**

- Node Progression: Harmony energy deposited into targeted campus nodes; visual changes on digital twin map (color shifts, particle effects).
- Event Triggers: Reaching thresholds spawns Gloom encounters, unlocks cooperative raids, or activates seasonal content.
- Narrative Advancement: New dialogue, cutscenes, or branching choices appear; supporting characters reveal personal questlines.
- Social Feedback: Guild leaderboards updated, community announcements broadcast, sponsors receive engagement analytics.
- Loop Closure: Aika summarizes impact (“Your dorm’s Harmony Node is now stable—ready to tackle the faculty-wide challenge?”) and seeds next quest cycle based on emerging needs.

### 5.2 Secondary Loops

- **Weekly Guild Raids:** Collective goals (e.g., “1,000 mindful minutes”).
- **Seasonal Festivals:** Limited-time events, sponsor booths.
- **Live Sessions:** Counselors host synchronous group quests.
- **Marketplace:** Trade cosmetic NFT relics, allocate `CARE`.

#### 5.2.1 Weekly Guild Raids

### 5.4 CareQuest Hub – Typing Combat System

The **CareQuest Hub** is a supplementary mini-game experience within the UGM-AICare Quest ecosystem. It combines **TypeRacer-style typing mechanics** with **idle clicker progression** to create an engaging, therapeutic gameplay loop where players type mental health affirmations and CBT phrases to defeat "Gloom" manifestations while earning `JOY`, `CARE`, and Harmony resources.

#### 5.4.1 Design Philosophy

**Why Typing Instead of Clicking?**

- **Therapeutic Reinforcement**: Typing positive affirmations and CBT reframes creates active cognitive engagement, strengthening neural pathways associated with self-compassion and emotional regulation (CBT repetition principle).
- **Skill Development**: Players improve typing speed while simultaneously learning Indonesian and English mental health vocabulary.
- **Meaningful Interaction**: Active typing requires focus and comprehension, preventing mindless grinding common in idle clickers.
- **Educational Integration**: Sentences can be sourced directly from active CBT modules, creating synergy with counselor-led therapy content.
- **Cultural Relevance**: Bilingual sentence database (Indonesian/English) supports language learning and culturally-appropriate mental health messaging for UGM students.

#### 5.4.2 Core Typing Mechanics

**Attack Flow:**

1. **Monster Appears**: Player encounters a Gloom manifestation (e.g., "Anxiety Goblin", "Stress Slime").
2. **Sentence Display**: System presents a mental health affirmation or CBT phrase matched to player's Harmony rank.
3. **Typing Input**: Player types the sentence character-by-character with real-time visual feedback.
4. **Damage Calculation**: Upon completion, damage is calculated based on typing speed (WPM), accuracy, upgrades, and combo multipliers.
5. **Reward Distribution**: Defeated monsters grant `JOY`, `CARE`, and Harmony score; resources sync with main quest system.

**Typing Validation:**

- **Character-by-Character Feedback**: Each typed character is immediately validated:
  - ✅ **Green**: Correct character
  - ❌ **Red + Shake**: Incorrect character (breaks combo, reduces accuracy)
  - ⏳ **Gray**: Not yet typed
- **No Copy-Paste**: Input validation prevents paste events to ensure authentic engagement.
- **Case Sensitivity**: Configurable per sentence (default: case-insensitive for accessibility).
- **Punctuation Required**: Commas, periods, and apostrophes must be typed correctly.

**Performance Metrics:**

```
WPM (Words Per Minute) = (Total Characters / 5) / (Time in Minutes)
Accuracy = (Correct Characters / Total Characters) × 100%
Mistakes = Count of Incorrect Keystrokes
```

#### 5.4.3 Damage Calculation System

**Base Damage Formula:**

```
Base Damage = (WPM / 60) × 0.5 × Accuracy Multiplier
Accuracy Multiplier = Accuracy Percentage (0.0 to 1.0)
```

**Total Damage Formula:**

```
Total Damage = Base Damage × Upgrade Multiplier × Combo Multiplier × Critical Multiplier
```

**Example Calculation:**

```
Given:
- WPM: 72
- Accuracy: 95% (0.95)
- Typing Power Upgrade: Level 5 (2.0x)
- Combo: 10 consecutive correct (1.5x)
- Critical Hit: Perfect accuracy (2.5x)

Calculation:
Base = (72 / 60) × 0.5 × 0.95 = 0.57
Total = 0.57 × 2.0 × 1.5 × 2.5 = 4.28 damage
```

**Multiplier Systems:**

| Multiplier Type | Trigger Condition | Effect | Notes |
|----------------|-------------------|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | Per sentence | 0% to 100% scaling | Linear scaling; 50% accuracy = 50% damage |
| **Perfect Bonus** | 100% accuracy | +50% base damage | Encourages precision over speed |
| **Combo (3x)** | 3 consecutive perfect | 1.1x | Resets on any mistake or timeout |
| **Combo (5x)** | 5 consecutive perfect | 1.25x | Encourages streak maintenance |
| **Combo (10x)** | 10 consecutive perfect | 1.5x | Significant skill reward |
| **Combo (20x)** | 20 consecutive perfect | 2.0x | Master-level achievement |
| **Critical Hit** | 100% accuracy | 2.5x total damage | Golden sparkle animation |
| **Auto-Healer** | Passive (upgrade) | +X DPS while idle | Idle game component |

**Combo Break Conditions:**

- Any typing mistake (wrong character)
- Taking longer than 15 seconds per sentence
- Manually skipping a sentence (if feature added)

#### 5.4.4 Monster & Boss System

**Monster Categories:**

| Type | HP Range | Appearance Rate | Reward Multiplier | Design Intent |
|------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Common** | 50-150 HP | 80% of spawns | 1.0x | Quick defeats for steady progression |
| **Boss** | 500-2000 HP | Every 10th stage | 5.0x to 10.0x | Multi-sentence challenges requiring sustained focus |

**Monster Progression:**

```
Monster HP = Base HP × (1 + Stage × 0.2) × Type Multiplier

Example:
Stage 5 Anxiety Goblin (Common, Base HP = 100):
HP = 100 × (1 + 5 × 0.2) × 1.0 = 200 HP

Stage 5 Exam Week Demon (Boss, Base HP = 500):
HP = 500 × (1 + 5 × 0.2) × 3.0 = 3000 HP
```

**Monster Types & Thematic Alignment:**

*Common Monsters (5 types):*

1. **Anxiety Goblin** – Blue-purple, represents worry and fear
2. **Stress Slime** – Green-yellow, represents overwhelm and fatigue
3. **Burnout Beast** – Orange-red, represents exhaustion and depletion
4. **Procrastination Imp** – Pink-purple, represents avoidance and delay
5. **Loneliness Wraith** – Gray-blue, represents isolation and disconnection

*Boss Monsters (5 types):*

1. **Exam Week Demon** – Red-purple, academic pressure personified
2. **Thesis Dragon** – Blue-gold, represents research anxiety and perfectionism
3. **Social Pressure Titan** – Multi-colored, crowd expectations manifestation
4. **Perfectionism Hydra** – Purple-gold, multi-headed self-criticism
5. **Imposter Syndrome Leviathan** – Dark blue-black, deep self-doubt serpent

**Boss Mechanics:**

- Require typing **3-5 sentences consecutively** to defeat
- HP bar divided into segments (one per sentence)
- Bonus rewards for maintaining perfect accuracy across all segments
- Special animations for boss defeat (particle effects, celebration toast)

#### 5.4.5 Sentence Database Structure

**Difficulty Tiers (1-6) Mapped to Harmony Ranks:**

| Difficulty | Harmony Range | Word Count | Sentence Categories | Target WPM | Example |
|-----------|---------------|------------|---------------------|------------|---------|

| **2** (Growing) | 100-499 | 6-9 words | Affirmations, Coping | 40-50 | "This feeling will pass eventually" |
| **3** (Balanced) | 500-1499 | 8-12 words | Coping, CBT Reframes | 50-60 | "I choose to respond with calm" |
| **4** (Thriving) | 1500-4999 | 10-15 words | CBT, Wisdom Quotes | 60-70 | "My worth is not defined by expectations" |
| **5** (Flourishing) | 5000-14999 | 12-18 words | Wisdom, Indonesian Sayings | 70-80 | "Progress is not linear and that is okay" |
| **6** (Masterful) | 15000+ | 15-30 words | Indonesian Proverbs, Complex CBT | 80+ | "Tak ada rotan akar pun jadi - resilience means finding strength within" |

**Sentence Categories:**

1. **Affirmations** (Difficulty 1-2): Basic self-worth and self-acceptance statements
2. **Coping Statements** (Difficulty 2-3): Emotional regulation and stress management phrases
3. **CBT Reframes** (Difficulty 3-4): Cognitive restructuring and thought challenging
4. **Wisdom Quotes** (Difficulty 4-5): Mental health principles from established frameworks
5. **Indonesian Sayings** (Difficulty 5-6): Cultural proverbs and bilingual mental health vocabulary

**Bilingual Support:**

- Each sentence has `text_en` (English) and `text_id` (Indonesian Bahasa) versions
- Players can toggle language preference in settings
- Mixed-language sentences at higher difficulties (e.g., Indonesian proverb with English explanation)

**Sentence Selection Algorithm:**

```
1. Determine player's current Harmony rank
2. Map rank to difficulty tier (1-6)
3. Retrieve allowed sentence categories for that tier
4. Filter by language preference
5. Exclude recently typed sentences (72-hour cooldown)
6. Randomly select from weighted pool (therapeutic value weighted)
7. Return sentence object with metadata (id, category, difficulty, words)
```

#### 5.4.6 Progression & Upgrade System

**Player Resources:**

- **`JOY`** (Primary): Earned from monster defeats, spent on most upgrades
- **`CARE`** (Secondary): Earned from bosses and perfect streaks, spent on rare upgrades
- **Harmony Score** (Prestige): Increases with consistent play, unlocks higher difficulty tiers

**Upgrade Types:**

| Upgrade Name | Icon | Description | Base Cost | Scaling | Currency | Effect |
|-------------|------|-------------|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Typing Power** | ✏️ | Damage per word typed | 10 `JOY` | 1.15^level | `JOY` | +20% base damage per level |
| **Auto-Healer** | ⚡ | Passive DPS while resting | 50 `JOY` | 1.15^level | `JOY` | +0.5 DPS per level (idle component) |
| **Critical Insight** | 🎯 | Perfect accuracy bonus | 100 `JOY` | 1.18^level | `JOY` | +5% crit multiplier per level |
| **Combo Mastery** | 📈 | Combo multipliers increased | 200 `JOY` | 1.20^level | Harmony | +15% to all combo bonuses |

**Upgrade Cost Formula:**

```
Cost = Base Cost × (Scaling Factor ^ Current Level)

Example (Typing Power at Level 5):
Cost = 10 × (1.15 ^ 5) = 10 × 2.011 = 20.11 ≈ 20 JOY
```

**Stage Progression:**

- **Stage** = Number of monsters defeated
- **Stage 10, 20, 30...**: Boss encounter (higher rewards)
- **Stage 50+**: "Harmony Rank Up" evaluation (increase difficulty tier if Harmony threshold met)
- **No stage cap**: Infinite progression with exponential scaling

**Prestige System (Future):**

- At Harmony Rank 6, option to "Ascend" (reset stage to 1, keep upgrades, gain permanent multipliers)
- Not included in MVP but designed for extensibility

#### 5.4.7 Integration with Main Quest System

**Resource Synchronization:**

- **Bi-directional Sync**: CareQuest Hub earnings automatically update player's main quest wallet (`JOY`, `CARE`, Harmony).
- **Sync Frequency**: Every 5 seconds while active, on game exit, and on quest completion in main system.
- **API Endpoint**: `PATCH /api/v1/quests/state/update` accepts delta updates (`joy_delta`, `care_delta`, `harmony_delta`).
- **Conflict Resolution**: Server-authoritative; client state reconciled on next sync.

**Cross-System Incentives:**

- **Daily Quest Bonus**: "Play 10 minutes of CareQuest Hub" quest awards bonus `JOY` (encourages engagement).
- **Typing Mastery Badges**: Achievements in hub (e.g., "10,000 words typed") displayed in main profile.
- **Sentence Unlocks**: Completing specific main quests unlocks exclusive sentence categories in hub.
- **Counselor Integration**: Counselors can assign "Practice these affirmations in CareQuest Hub" as therapy homework.

**Analytics Integration:**

- Hub gameplay metrics (WPM, accuracy, session duration) feed into player wellness analytics.
- Insights Agent can correlate typing patterns with mood trends (e.g., "Accuracy drops 20% during exam weeks").
- Aggregate data informs sentence database curation (popular categories, difficulty appropriateness).

#### 5.4.8 User Experience Flow

**First-Time User Flow:**

1. **Onboarding Tutorial**: Guided walkthrough typing 3 simple affirmations with visual callouts explaining mechanics.
2. **Difficulty Calibration**: System observes initial WPM and accuracy, adjusts starting Harmony rank accordingly.
3. **Reward Explanation**: First monster defeat triggers detailed breakdown of damage calculation and resource earnings.
4. **Upgrade Unlock**: After Stage 3, unlock first upgrade with tutorial tooltip.
5. **Main Quest Link**: Toast notification: "Your JOY earnings are now available in your main quest wallet!"

**Returning Player Flow:**

1. Load saved game state from localStorage and backend wellness API.
2. Display current stage, Harmony rank, and available resources.
3. Present current monster with pre-selected sentence.
4. Auto-resume with Auto-Healer passive damage accumulation displayed.

**Session End Flow:**

1. **Progress Summary**: Modal showing session stats (words typed, monsters defeated, resources earned, WPM average).
2. **Milestone Achievements**: If any milestones reached (e.g., "50 perfect sentences"), display celebratory animation.
3. **Sync Confirmation**: "Your progress has been saved and synced to your main profile."
4. **Encouragement**: Aika-style supportive message ("Great focus today! Your typing improved by 5 WPM.").

#### 5.4.9 Therapeutic Benefits & Design Rationale

**Evidence-Based Design:**

1. **Repetition & Neuroplasticity**: Typing affirmations repeatedly creates stronger memory encoding compared to passive reading (cognitive science principle).
2. **Dual-Task Engagement**: Combining motor skills (typing) with cognitive processing (comprehension) enhances learning retention.
3. **Flow State Induction**: Balanced challenge (sentence difficulty matches skill) creates immersive therapeutic engagement.
4. **Immediate Feedback Loop**: Real-time accuracy indicators provide behavior reinforcement, crucial for habit formation.
5. **Gamified Exposure Therapy**: Repeated exposure to positive self-statements in low-stakes environment reduces resistance to therapeutic concepts.

**Differentiation from Mindless Clicking:**

| Aspect | Traditional Idle Clicker | CareQuest Typing Hub |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Engagement** | Mindless repetition | Active cognitive processing |
| **Skill Development** | None | Typing speed + mental health literacy |
| **Therapeutic Value** | Zero | High (CBT reinforcement) |
| **Educational** | No learning | Bilingual vocabulary + coping strategies |
| **Burnout Risk** | High (repetitive strain) | Low (varied content, skill practice) |
| **Accessibility** | Limited | Screen reader compatible, adjustable difficulty |

**Mental Health Safeguards:**

- **No Punishment for Mistakes**: Low accuracy reduces damage but never penalizes with loss of resources or negative feedback.
- **Compassion Mode Trigger**: If player struggles with accuracy (<50% for 5 consecutive sentences), system offers easier alternatives or break suggestion.
- **No Time Pressure**: While WPM affects damage, there's no countdown timer causing anxiety.
- **Positive Framing Only**: All UI text uses supportive language ("Keep practicing!" vs "You failed").
- **Opt-Out Anytime**: Players can exit mid-session without penalty; progress auto-saves.

#### 5.4.10 Technical Specifications

**Performance Requirements:**

- **Input Latency**: <50ms between keystroke and visual feedback
- **WPM Calculation**: Real-time update every 500ms
- **Animation Frame Rate**: 60 FPS for smooth character transitions and damage numbers

| **Daily Solo** | Journaling, gratitude, sleep check-ins | Time-based, AI prompts | XP, `JOY` |
| **Structured Therapy** | Session attendance, CBT homework | Counselor schedule | XP, `CARE`, Mentor badge upgrade |
| **Peer Support** | Encourage guildmate, share resource | Social feeds, event | Harmony score, guild buffs |
| **Exploration** | AR campus scavenger, story nodes | Geo-tagged hints | Cosmetic NFTs, lore fragments |
| **Emergency Support** | Crisis plan review, hotline contact | Safety flag, counselor | Shield booster, relapse vault bonus |

#### 6.1.1 Quest Lifecycle

- **Generation**: Quest Engine composes bundles using player personas, current Harmony Node status, calendar entries (exam periods, holidays), counselor directives, and safety overrides. Weighted randomization balances novelty with wellness adherence; duplication guard prevents repeated tasks within 72 hours.
- **Presentation**: Each quest payload includes objective description, rationale, estimated effort, sensitivity rating, recommended companions, and adaptive hints. Payloads are signed to prevent tampering and cached for offline initiation.
- **Execution Tracking**: Client emits progress telemetry (start, pause, resume, completion) with device metadata. Long-duration quests send heartbeat pings every 5 minutes; missing heartbeats triggers gentle reminders rather than failure.
- **Validation**: Submission validators confirm schema, rate limits, and contextual proof:
  - Structured data (journals) scanned for toxicity and minimal length.
  - Attendance quests require counselor confirmation or integration with scheduling system.
  - Peer support tasks cross-check moderator approvals to avoid reward farming.
- **Post-Processing**: Validated completions publish events to Rewards Calculator, update streak services, notify Dialogue Orchestrator, and append to analytics pipelines.

#### 6.1.2 Dynamic Difficulty & Personalization

- **Adaptive Profiles**: Difficulty score recalculated daily based on streak length, mood volatility, self-reported stress, counselor feedback, and time availability. Players can opt in/out of challenge tiers.
- **Quest Chains**: Multi-step arcs unlock when prerequisites met. Branches alter subsequent objectives—e.g., failing a stress-management quest pivots to supportive reflection before reattempt.
- **Mentor Overrides**: Counselors/guild leaders can pin mandatory quests (e.g., crisis response) with player consent. Overrides expire after completion or 48 hours to avoid overload.
- **Safety Guardrails**: High-sensitivity quests allow snooze/skip without penalty, surface hotline buttons, and send silent alerts to counselors if declined repeatedly.

### 6.2 Progression & Stats

- **Avatar Level** = XP from quests; unlocks skills (e.g., Calm Burst).
- **Harmony Score** = Weighted average of quest consistency, peer support.
- **Mood Attributes** (Calm, Focus, Connection, Resilience) tracked via check-ins; affect quest success probability.
- **Guild Rank** = Aggregated Harmony Score + event contributions.

#### 6.2.1 Progression Formulas

- **XP Curve**: Required XP per level = `base_xp * level^1.2`. Weekly booster adds 10% bonus for first 5 quests to encourage early engagement; cap prevents exceeding 3 levels/week.
- **Harmony Score Calculation**:
  - 40% quest completion ratio (weighted by difficulty & therapeutic value).
  - 30% social contribution index (peer support validated by positive sentiment).
  - 20% streak consistency (normalized).
  - 10% counselor feedback (manual or automated).
  Score decays 5% weekly when inactive; Compassion Mode can freeze decay once per month.
- **Mood Attribute Influence**: Each quest requires minimum mood thresholds; failing threshold reduces reward multiplier but unlocks restorative quests. Attributes regenerate via targeted tasks and counselor interventions.
- **Skill Trees**: Archetype-specific trees (Seer, Resonator, Pathfinder) with passive (e.g., +5% Harmony from reflective quests) and active abilities (Lightstorm boosts). Unlock via level milestones and special achievements.

### 6.3 Combat Analogue - "Gloom Encounters"

1. Node enters Gloom state (e.g., exam stress week).
2. Players contribute actions (breathing exercises, group study sessions).
3. Each action charges "Lightstorm." When threshold met, boss shield breaks.
4. Final counselor-led event resolves encounter, distributes rare drops.

#### 6.3.1 Encounter Phases

- **Calibration Phase**: Upon activation, encounter engine estimates participant volume, average Harmony Score, and risk indicators to scale boss HP, shield layers, and required action mix.
- **Shield Phase**: Diversified objectives—e.g., 40% wellness routines, 30% peer support, 30% learning activities—to prevent single-strategy exploits. Live dashboards show real-time progress by category.
- **Core Exposure Phase**: Triggered during scheduled live session. Interactive polls, reflective prompts, or guided breathing reduce core stability. Counselors adapt prompts based on sentiment feedback.
- **Recovery Phase**: Post-event reflective quests, gratitude walls, and communal celebrations ensure psychological closure. Rewards distributed via fairness algorithm (participation threshold + contribution weighting + anti-bot heuristics).

### 6.4 Failure & Support

- Missing streak triggers "Compassion Mode": lower quest intensity, supportive messages, option to request counselor outreach.
- "Relapse Protection Vault" offers financial and in-game safety net (see economy).

#### 6.4.1 Intervention Mechanics

- **Compassion Mode**: Activates automatically after two consecutive missed dailies or manual request. Reduces daily quest load by 40%, increases supportive narrative prompts, pauses Harmony decay. Exits after completion of a reset quest or counselor override.
- **Relapse Vault Workflow**: Players stake `CARE`; if streak drops below threshold, portion of stake redirected to emergency support while player receives stipend (`JOY`, therapy voucher). DAO defines parameters to deter exploitation.
- **Counselor Escalation**: High-risk signals create high-priority tickets. Counselors view synthesized dossier (latest mood logs, quest history) before outreach; all access logged for compliance.
- **Analytics Feedback**: Failure events aggregated for Live Ops dashboards to adjust quest difficulty/time windows rapidly; A/B tests evaluate effectiveness of Compassion Mode tweaks.

- **UI IDs**: `ui-{screen}-{component}` (e.g., `ui-dashboard-lightstorm-meter`).

### Naming Usage Rules

- Always reference modules using abbreviations in engineering discussions after first mention.
- Player-facing copy must never expose internal abbreviations (`Harmony Node`, not `HND`).
- When multiple modules appear in one document, list them in execution order (QES → RCS → DOS).
- Feature flags follow `feat.{module}.{slug}` (e.g., `feat.qes.chain-difficulty`).

### 16.7 Narrative Tone & Style Guide

**Voice & Mood**

- Core tone: empathetic, hopeful, collaborative. Aim for “supportive mentor + campus ally”.
- Default tense: present. Default POV: second person when addressing players; first-person plural for guild/community messaging.
- Language: professional yet warm; integrate Bahasa Indonesia terms sparingly (e.g., “semangat”, “gotong royong”) with contextual translations.

**Aika’s Voice**

- Traits: compassionate, concise, actionable. Avoid sarcasm or rigid formal speech.
- Sentence structure: short to medium length, inclusive language (“Let’s try…”, “We can…”).
- Provide one actionable tip per dialogue turn, offer opt-out phrase (“If today feels heavy, we can pause.”).

**Counselor & Mentor Voice**

- Professional, reassuring, grounded in therapeutic practice. Use evidence-based phrasing (“Try a 4-7-8 breathing cycle.”).
- Avoid guarantees (“This will fix…”)—use invitations (“Consider exploring…”).

**Narrative Copy Rules**

- Avoid stigmatizing terms (“crazy”, “insane”). Prefer neutral descriptors (“intense stress”, “overwhelmed”).
- Highlight collective effort (“Your guild rallied…”).
- Keep quest descriptions under 120 words, include:
  1. **Context** (why it matters),
  2. **Action** (what to do),
  3. **Reflection** (optional journaling prompt).
- Example Quest Template:

  ```
  Title: Calm the Library Courtyard
  Context: “The courtyard has felt tense since midterms started.”
  Action: “Spend 10 minutes practicing your chosen breathing technique. Log how your body feels after.”
  Reflection: “What changed in your focus during the exercise?”
  Reward Callout: “Earn +25 Harmony and a Serenity Spark for your guild.”
  ```

**Forbidden Constructions**

- No gendered assumptions or heteronormative framing.
- No age-based diminutives (“kids”, “grown-ups”). Refer to “students”, “players”, “counselors”.
- Avoid imperative commands without softeners (“You must”). Use supportive invitations (“Let’s try”, “Consider”).

**Localization Tips**

- Provide bilingual subtitles for story cinematics (English + Bahasa Indonesia).
- Use metric units (minutes, kilometers) and regional time/date formats (dd MMM yyyy, 24-hour clock).
- Cultural references should align with Indonesian context (Ramadan, exam weeks, student organizations).

- **Gradient Recipes**: `linear-gradient(140deg, #001D58 0%, #0A2A6E 45%, #173A7A 100%)`; button hover overlay `rgba(255, 202, 64, 0.18)`.
- **Typography**:
  - Display: `Poppins SemiBold` (titles, 32/40/44 pt).
  - Body: `Inter Regular` (14/16/18 pt).
  - Fallback stack: `Inter, Poppins, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif`.
- **Iconography**: Thin 1.5px stroke, rounded corners, 45° diagonal highlights. Icons exported as 48x48 SVG with naming `ic-{category}-{name}.svg`.

**UI Layout Standards**

- Grid: 8px base spacing; major sections snap to 128px multiples.
- Card layout: 24px padding, 12px corner radius, background `rgba(255,255,255,0.06)`, border `1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.10)`.
- Status colors:
  - Success `#34D399`,
  - Warning `#FBBF24`,
  - Critical `#F87171`,
  - Neutral `#A5B4FC`.
- Animation: Use cubic-bezier (.4, 0, .2, 1); default enter animation 250ms fade + 12px upward translate; micro-interactions <=180ms.

**Asset Production Pipeline**

- **2D Assets**: Generated via AI prompt template → curated in Photoshop → exported in PNG (UI) or SVG (icons). Maintain source PSD/AI in `/designs/source`.
- **3D Assets**: Modeled low-poly in Blender (LOD0 ≤ 8k tris). Provide LOD1 (~50% tri reduction) and LOD2 (~15%). Uses PBR materials; texture atlases 2048x2048 max.
- **Rendering Style**: Ambient occlusion baked subtle, emissive accents for Harmony energy, batik motifs projected via decals.
- **Sprite Sheets**: Animated sprites at 8 frames per loop, 320x320 frame size, naming `spr_{character}_{state}_v{version}.png`.
- **File Naming**:
  - Concept art: `concept_{subject}_{artistInitials}_{YYMMDD}.png`
  - Final UI asset: `ui_{screen}_{component}_{state}.svg`
  - 3D model: `mdl_{subject}_{lod}.glb`
  - Animation: `ani_{subject}_{action}_{fps}.json`
- **Versioning & Storage**: All final assets stored in `design-system/ugc-quest/` repository with Git LFS. Meta file `assets-manifest.json` tracks checksum, author, license.

**Accessibility Art Guidelines**

- Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for iconography.
- Provide alt-text descriptions referencing mental wellness context (“Illustration of Aika offering a glowing Harmony orb”).
- Motion sensitivity: Provide toggle to disable particle overlays; ensure critical information not conveyed solely by color.

**Animation & VFX Standards**

- Particle systems limited to 300 particles/frame on mid-tier devices.
- Gloom effects use muted purple `#7C3AED` with opacity ≤60% to avoid eye strain.
- Avatar emotes 1.2s loop, easing in/out; Lightstorm charge effect 750ms ramp with subtle camera shake (amplitude ≤4px).
