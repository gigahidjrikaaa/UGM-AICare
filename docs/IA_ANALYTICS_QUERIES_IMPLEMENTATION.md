## Query Specifications

### 1. crisis_trend (486 chars)

**Purpose**: Track crisis escalations over time by severity level

**SQL Logic**:

```sql
SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(*) as crisis_count, severity,
       COUNT(DISTINCT user_hash) as unique_users_affected
FROM cases
WHERE created_at >= :start_date AND created_at < :end_date
  AND severity IN ('high', 'critical')
GROUP BY DATE(created_at), severity
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5  -- k-anonymity
ORDER BY date DESC
```

**Output**:

- Chart: Line chart of crisis cases per day
- Table: date, crisis_count, severity, unique_users_affected
- Privacy: Daily aggregation, minimum 5 cases per group

---

### 2. dropoffs (1,212 chars)

**Purpose**: Session abandonment and engagement metrics

**SQL Logic**:

```sql
SELECT DATE(c.created_at) as date,
       COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) as total_sessions,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN (msg_count <= 2) THEN c.id END) as early_dropoffs,
       ROUND((early_dropoffs / total_sessions) * 100, 2) as dropoff_percentage,
       AVG(msg_count) as avg_messages_per_conversation
FROM conversations c
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT conversation_id, COUNT(*) as msg_count
  FROM messages
  GROUP BY conversation_id
) m ON m.conversation_id = c.id
WHERE c.created_at >= :start_date
GROUP BY DATE(c.created_at)
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) >= 5
```

**Output**:

- Chart: Bar chart (early dropoffs vs completed sessions)
- Table: date, total_sessions, early_dropoffs, dropoff_percentage, avg_messages
- Privacy: Minimum 5 sessions per day

**Key Metric**: Early dropoff = conversations with ≤2 messages

       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE 
         WHEN ipr.last_viewed_at IS NOT NULL 
           AND ipr.last_viewed_at > ipr.created_at 
         THEN ipr.id 
       END) as plans_revisited,
       ROUND((plans_revisited / total_plans) * 100, 2) as revisit_rate,
       AVG(ipr.completed_steps::NUMERIC / NULLIF(ipr.total_steps, 0) * 100) as avg_completion_percentage

## Privacy & Security Features

### K-Anonymity Enforcement

All queries include `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5` to ensure minimum group size of 5, preventing small group identification.

### Date Range Validation

- IA LangGraph ingest_query_node validates date ranges (max 365 days)
- All queries use `:start_date` and `:end_date` parameters
- No unbounded queries allowed

### Aggregate-Only Data

- No individual user identification possible
- No PII in query results
- All calculations use aggregations (COUNT, AVG, SUM)

### Consent-Aware Analytics

- Allow-listed queries only (no arbitrary SQL execution)
- IA LangGraph validate_consent_node checks query approval
- Aggregate statistics have implicit consent (no opt-in required)

---

## Integration Points

### 1. InsightsAgentService Execution Flow

```python
# User request → IAQueryRequest
request = IAQueryRequest(
    question_id="crisis_trend",
    params=QueryParams(start=start_date, end=end_date)
)

# Service executes raw SQL
sql_query = ALLOWED_QUERIES[question_id]
result = await session.execute(text(sql_query), {"start_date": start, "end_date": end})
rows = result.fetchall()

# Format results
response = formatter(rows, start, end)  # → IAQueryResponse
```

### 2. LangGraph IA Workflow Integration

```
User Query
  ↓
ingest_query_node (validate structure, date ranges)
  ↓
validate_consent_node (check allow-listed queries)
  ↓
apply_k_anonymity_node (set k_threshold=5)
  ↓
execute_analytics_node (call InsightsAgentService.query())
  ↓
state["analytics_result"] = IAQueryResponse
  ↓
END
```

### 3. REST API Endpoint

```bash
POST /api/v1/agents/ia/query
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "question_id": "crisis_trend",
  "params": {
    "start": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "end": "2025-02-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Testing & Validation

### Syntax Validation (✅ PASSED)

```bash
$ python backend/test_ia_queries_syntax.py

✅ VALID: crisis_trend (486 chars)
✅ VALID: dropoffs (1212 chars)
✅ VALID: resource_reuse (1133 chars)
✅ VALID: fallback_reduction (1306 chars)
✅ VALID: cost_per_helpful (1504 chars)
✅ VALID: coverage_windows (1112 chars)

✅ ALL QUERIES VALIDATED SUCCESSFULLY
```

### Type Checking (✅ PASSED)

- All formatter functions use `Sequence[Row[Any]]` type annotations
- No type errors reported by Pylance/mypy

### Database Integration (⏳ PENDING)

Requires testing with sample data in PostgreSQL database:

1. Create sample conversations, cases, assessments, intervention plans
2. Execute queries via InsightsAgentService
3. Verify k-anonymity enforcement (test with <5 rows)
4. Check result format matches IAQueryResponse schema

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Crisis Trend Analysis

```python
from app.agents.ia.service import InsightsAgentService
from app.agents.ia.schemas import IAQueryRequest, QueryParams
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Last 30 days
end_date = datetime.now()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)

request = IAQueryRequest(
    question_id="crisis_trend",
    params=QueryParams(start=start_date, end=end_date)
)

async with AsyncSession(...) as session:
    service = InsightsAgentService(session)
    response = await service.query(request)
    
    # response.chart: Line chart data for Grafana
    # response.table: Raw data for CSV export
    # response.notes: Context for interpretation
```

### Example 2: AI Resolution Rate

```python
request = IAQueryRequest(
    question_id="fallback_reduction",
    params=QueryParams(start=start_date, end=end_date)
)

response = await service.query(request)
# response.chart: Pie chart (AI-handled vs escalated)
# response.table: Daily breakdown of resolution rates
```

### Example 3: Coverage Heatmap

```python
request = IAQueryRequest(
    question_id="coverage_windows",
    params=QueryParams(start=start_date, end=end_date)
)

response = await service.query(request)
# response.chart: Bar chart of hourly activity
# response.table: Hour x Day heatmap data
```
