## The Problem

University counseling services are structurally reactive. Students must recognize their own distress, decide to seek help, navigate an appointment system, and wait — often weeks. By the time a student reaches a counselor, the opportunity for early intervention has already passed.

The counselor-to-student ratio at most universities sits around 1:1000. No amount of hiring closes that gap. The tools need to change.

UGM-AICare reframes the problem: instead of waiting for students to ask for help, the system proactively identifies distress signals, intervenes early, and hands off to human counselors only when it matters most.

## What Was Built

A full-stack, production-deployed system consisting of:

- A **multi-agent AI orchestration layer** built on LangGraph, coordinating four specialized agents under a meta-agent (Aika)
- A **covert mental health screening engine** that passively maps natural conversation to nine clinically validated instruments (PHQ-9, GAD-7, DASS-21, C-SSRS, and five others)
- A **policy-gated autopilot** that governs when Aika can act autonomously versus when a human must approve
- An **onchain attestation ledger** recording every consequential AI action as a verifiable proof with transaction hashes
- An **NFT achievement system** (ERC1155) that gives students tamper-proof ownership of their wellness milestones
- A **counselor and admin dashboard** for case management, agent decision auditing, and population-level insights

Everything is live. The backend serves real users at [api.aicare.sumbu.xyz](https://api.aicare.sumbu.xyz). Smart contracts are deployed on BSC Testnet. The proof timeline at `/proof` shows actual transaction hashes.

## Aika and the Agent Network

Aika is not a chatbot. She is a **meta-agent orchestrator** that classifies every incoming message, routes it to the right specialized agent, synthesizes a response, and updates a persistent screening profile — all within a single LangGraph StateGraph execution.

| Agent | Role | What it actually does |
|-------|------|-----------------------|
| **Aika** | Meta-Agent Orchestrator | Intent classification, agent routing, response synthesis, longitudinal profile updates |
| **STA** | Safety Triage Agent | Two-tier risk scoring (regex in <5ms, then Gemini 2.5 semantic analysis). Outputs risk levels 0–3. |
| **TCA** | Therapeutic Coach Agent | CBT-based interventions — cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, guided relaxation |
| **CMA** | Case Management Agent | Creates escalation cases, routes to counselors by specialty and workload, schedules follow-ups |
| **IA** | Insights Agent | k-anonymous population analytics with differential privacy guarantees |

**Risk escalation path:**

- Level 0 — Normal conversation. Aika engages naturally.
- Level 1 — Mild distress detected. Aika monitors and offers light support.
- Level 2 — Moderate risk. TCA activates with evidence-based interventions.
- Level 3 — Crisis signal. CMA immediately escalates to a human counselor. No AI responses are generated at this level without human oversight.

## Covert Screening Engine

Every conversation passively updates a structured screening profile using nine validated psychological instruments. Users are not told they are being assessed — this intentional design reduces social desirability bias and surfaces authentic signals that self-report forms miss.

| Instrument | Domains Tracked |
|------------|-----------------|
| PHQ-9 | Depression, anhedonia, suicidal ideation |
| GAD-7 | Generalized anxiety, uncontrollable worry |
| DASS-21 | Stress, nervous arousal, irritability |
| PSQI | Sleep quality, efficiency, daytime dysfunction |
| UCLA Loneliness Scale v3 | Social and emotional isolation |
| Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale | Self-worth, self-acceptance |
| AUDIT | Alcohol use patterns, coping drinking |
| C-SSRS | Suicidality spectrum from ideation through planning |
| SSI (adapted) | Academic stress, thesis pressure, fear of failure |

Scores update using exponential decay — `new = old × 0.95 + extracted × 0.05` — so recent signals carry more weight without discarding longitudinal history. The screening admin dashboard (`/admin/screening`) surfaces population trends anonymized to k≥5 groups.

## Policy-Gated Autopilot

The autopilot layer is where this project moves beyond a conversational AI. Aika does not execute onchain actions directly. Every proposed action passes through a policy engine that classifies it by risk tier:

| Tier | Disposition | Example actions |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Low** | Auto-approved, executes immediately | Minting a streak badge after 7 consecutive days |
| **Moderate** | Queued for admin review | Creating a counseling case for a student |
| **High** | Denied by default | Any action touching financial contracts or personal data export |

Approved actions are dispatched to an async worker that handles submission, retry scheduling, and dead-letter tracking. The transaction hash and chain ID are stored against the original action record. This creates a full audit trail from Aika's decision through to on-chain confirmation.

**Verification surfaces for judges:**

- Admin queue: https://aicare.sumbu.xyz/admin/autopilot
- Proof timeline: https://aicare.sumbu.xyz/proof
- REST API: `/api/v1/admin/autopilot/actions`, `…/approve`, `…/reject`
- Replay script: `python scripts/replay_autopilot_demo.py`
- Demo artifact: `docs/autopilot_demo_artifact.json`

> **Note on demo mode:** If `AUTOPILOT_ONCHAIN_PLACEHOLDER=true`, transaction hashes are synthetic. Backend startup logs include explicit warnings whenever a placeholder hash is generated. Switching to live onchain submission requires replacing the placeholder handlers in the autopilot execution paths.

## Onchain Layer

### Achievement Badges — `UGMJournalBadges.sol` (ERC1155)

Wellness milestones are minted as NFTs students actually own. Streaks (3, 7, 14, 30 days), journal milestones, and extended chat sessions each correspond to a distinct token ID.

- **Contract:** `0x8c251c055BC712246392C8229e5ad95859c48AFe`
- **Network:** BSC Testnet (Chain ID: 97)
- **Explorer:** https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x8c251c055BC712246392C8229e5ad95859c48AFe
- **Sync your badges:** https://aicare.sumbu.xyz/dashboard → Achievements → "Sync badges"

### Attestation Registry — `BSCAttestationRegistry.sol`

Every confirmed autopilot action writes an attestation record onchain: what happened, who authorized it, and when. This satisfies the accountability requirement for a system acting on behalf of vulnerable users.

- **Contract:** `0x6F91e908833FcECEbAdFEEC5Ee6576916E34e09F`
- **Network:** BSC Testnet (Chain ID: 97)
- **Explorer:** https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x6F91e908833FcECEbAdFEEC5Ee6576916E34e09F

## Privacy and Clinical Governance

This is not a toy. The system processes sensitive mental health data for real students, so governance is not optional.

- **k-Anonymity (k≥5):** The Insights Agent refuses to return any aggregate smaller than five individuals. Population queries cannot be narrowed to identify specific users.
- **Differential Privacy:** Noise injection (ε-δ budgets) is applied before serving trend data to the admin dashboard.
- **PII Redaction:** All conversation text is scrubbed of names, phone numbers, and email addresses before storage or downstream analysis.
- **Human-in-the-Loop at Level 3:** No AI response is generated for crisis-level signals. CMA routes to a human counselor immediately.
- **Consent Ledger:** User consent grants and withdrawals are recorded as immutable audit entries.

## Why This Fits the Agent Track

Most AI agent demos stop at tool calling. UGM-AICare goes further on three dimensions:

**1. Real-world stakes.** The system handles mental health triage for university students. A missed escalation or a hallucinated intervention has consequences. The architecture reflects that — covert screening, validated instruments, risk-tiered routing, and mandatory human oversight at the crisis level.

**2. Verifiable autonomy.** Aika's decisions are not black boxes. Every consequential action passes through a policy engine, gets recorded in the autopilot queue, and writes an attestation onchain. Judges can verify the proof timeline at `/proof` with actual transaction hashes.

**3. Longitudinal intelligence.** Unlike a stateless chatbot, Aika maintains a persistent screening profile per user, updated across every session using nine validated instruments. The system gets more accurate over time, not just more conversational.
