# Backend — API Overview

## Structure

The backend is a **FastAPI** application organised around the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principle: each business domain lives in its own directory with its own routes, schemas, services, and models.

```
backend/app/
├── agents/          # All AI agent graphs and logic
│   ├── aika/        # Aika identity, tools, activity logger
│   ├── sta/         # Safety Triage Agent graph
│   ├── tca/         # Therapeutic Coach Agent graph
│   ├── cma/         # Case Management Agent graph

```

## Authentication

All API endpoints (except `/health` and the auth endpoints) require a **JWT bearer token**. Tokens are issued by the `/auth/login` endpoint and verified on every request via the `verify_token` dependency.

Roles are encoded in the JWT payload:

```json
{
  "sub": "1203",
  "role": "user",
  "email": "student@mail.ugm.ac.id",
  "exp": 1740700000
}
```

The `role` field determines which API endpoints are accessible and which Aika tools are available.

| `POST` | `/api/v1/chat` | Send a message, receive text response |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/chat/stream/{session_id}` | SSE stream for real-time token streaming |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/chat/history/{conversation_id}` | Fetch full conversation history |

### Appointments

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/appointments` | List user's appointments |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/appointments` | Create new appointment |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/appointments/{id}` | Reschedule or cancel |

### Cases (Counsellor/Admin only)

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/cases` | List all active cases |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/cases/{id}` | Get case details |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/cases/{id}/status` | Update case status |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/cases/{id}/attest` | Submit blockchain attestation |

### Analytics (Admin/Counsellor only)

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/analytics/risk-trends` | Population risk trend data |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/analytics/screening` | Aggregate screening indicators |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/analytics/intervention-funnel` | Stage funnel metrics |

### STA (Manual triggers — Counsellor/Admin only)

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/sta/analyze/{conversation_id}` | Manually trigger STA analysis |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/sta/assessment/{conversation_id}` | Fetch STA report for a conversation |

---

## Rate Limiting

API endpoints are rate-limited via Redis to prevent abuse:

| Endpoint Group | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Chat (`/api/v1/chat`) | 30 requests / minute per user |
| Analytics | 60 requests / minute per user |
| Auth | 10 requests / minute per IP |
| All others | 120 requests / minute per user |

Rate limit headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`) are included in every response.

---

## Error Handling

All errors follow a consistent JSON structure:

```json
{
  "detail": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "You have exceeded the request limit. Try again in 45 seconds.",
    "retry_after": 45
  }
}
```

HTTP status codes follow standard conventions: `400` for validation errors, `401` for missing/invalid tokens, `403` for role-permission failures, `429` for rate limits, and `500` for unexpected server errors (with no stack trace exposed to the client).
