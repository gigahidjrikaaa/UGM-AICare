## 1. Mission and Problem Statement

### Title

"Transforming University Mental Health Support: An Agentic AI Framework for Proactive Intervention and Resource Management"

### The Challenge

University mental health services remain reactive, under-resourced, and data-constrained. Scaling compassionate support requires:

- **Early detection** and proactive intervention rather than crisis-only response
- **Coordinated automation** across clinical care, therapeutic coaching, and operational workflows
- **Institution-grade privacy**, consent management, and clinical audit controls

### Solution Goal

Deliver a Safety Agent Suite that combines high-sensitivity crisis detection with evidence-based CBT-informed coaching, clinical case management, and privacy-preserving aggregate analytics‚Äîall under explicit professional oversight and verifiable privacy guarantees.

## 2. Safety Agent Suite Overview

**LangGraph StateGraph Orchestration** (Implemented: October 2025)

The Safety Agent Suite is now implemented as a **LangGraph-orchestrated multi-agent system** with deterministic state machines, typed state management, and conditional routing. All four agents operate through compiled StateGraph workflows with real-time execution tracking.

**Orchestration Architecture:**
```
User Message ‚Üí STA (Triage) ‚Üí [Low/Moderate] ‚Üí SCA (Coach) ‚Üí END
                             ‚Üí [High/Critical] ‚Üí SDA (Escalate) ‚Üí END
Analytics Queries ‚Üí IA (Privacy-Preserving Aggregation) ‚Üí END
```

**Core LangGraph Components:**
- **StateGraph**: Workflow orchestration with typed state (`SafetyAgentState`, `IAState` TypedDict)
- **Nodes**: Agent operations (e.g., `triage_node`, `generate_plan_node`, `create_case_node`)
- **Edges**: Conditional routing based on risk level, intent classification, and consent validation
- **Execution Tracking**: Real-time monitoring via `ExecutionStateTracker` with database persistence
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling at node level with state preservation

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Triage Agent (STA)

- **Scope:** Real-time message classification, risk scoring (Level 0-3), and escalation routing inside the user chat experience
- **Key Features:** PII redaction before assessment, crisis banner orchestration, consent-aware disclosures, feature-flagged crisis protocols, automated professional referral, audit logging
- **LangGraph Implementation:** 4-node workflow (`apply_redaction` ‚Üí `classify_intent` ‚Üí `assess_risk` ‚Üí `route_to_agent`)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **LangGraph Complete** (`backend/app/agents/sta/sta_graph.py`, smoke tests passing)

### üí¨ Support Coach Agent (SCA)

- **Scope:** CBT-informed personalized coaching, brief micro-interventions, and evidence-based therapeutic guidance
- **Key Features:** Empathetic dialogue, structured self-help modules (anxiety management, stress reduction), therapeutic exercise guidance, intervention plan generation, progress tracking
- **LangGraph Implementation:** 4-node workflow (`validate_intervention_need` ‚Üí `classify_intervention_type` ‚Üí `generate_plan` ‚Üí `persist_plan`)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **LangGraph Complete** (`backend/app/agents/sca/sca_graph.py`)

### üóÇÔ∏è Service Desk Agent (SDA)

- **Scope:** Operational command center for clinical staff (case management, SLA tracking, follow-up workflows)
- **Key Features:** Case creation, escalation workflows, SLA calculation with breach prediction, clinical staff auto-assignment, interoperability hooks for campus systems
- **LangGraph Implementation:** 4-node workflow (`validate_escalation` ‚Üí `create_case` ‚Üí `calculate_sla` ‚Üí `auto_assign`)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **LangGraph Complete** (`backend/app/agents/sda/sda_graph.py`)

### üîç Insights Agent (IA)

- **Scope:** Privacy-preserving analytics over anonymized events/messages with differential privacy guarantees
- **Key Features:** k-anonymity enforcement (k‚â•5), allow-listed queries (6 pre-approved analytics questions), differential privacy budget tracking (Œµ-Œ¥), consent-aware dimensions, aggregate trend analysis, clinical approval checkpoints
- **LangGraph Implementation:** 4-node workflow (`ingest_query` ‚Üí `validate_consent` ‚Üí `apply_k_anonymity` ‚Üí `execute_analytics`)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **LangGraph Complete** (`backend/app/agents/ia/ia_graph.py`, smoke tests passing)

**Master Orchestrator:** `backend/app/agents/orchestrator_graph.py` coordinates STA‚ÜíSCA/SDA routing with conditional edges and subgraph invocation.

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/agents/graph/sta/execute` - Execute STA workflow only
- `POST /api/v1/agents/graph/orchestrator/execute` - Full orchestration (STA‚ÜíSCA/SDA)
- `POST /api/v1/agents/graph/ia/execute` - Execute IA analytics workflow
- `GET /api/v1/agents/graph/*/health` - Health checks with feature listings

**Documentation:** See `docs/langgraph-phase5-complete.md` for complete implementation details, code samples, and architecture diagrams.

**Transitional Guidance:** Legacy n8n agent references are deprecated. All new development must use LangGraph StateGraph patterns. Reference `docs/DEPRECATED.md` for migration guidance.

## 3. Technical Architecture Snapshot

### Backend Platform (FastAPI + LangChain + LangGraph)

- **Target Structure:** `backend/app/agents/{sta,sca,sda,ia}/` packages with LangGraph StateGraph implementations
  - Each agent has: `*_graph.py` (StateGraph definition), `*_graph_service.py` (service wrapper), `service.py` (core logic)
  - Shared state schemas: `backend/app/agents/graph_state.py` (`SafetyAgentState`, `IAState` TypedDict)
  - Master orchestrator: `backend/app/agents/orchestrator_graph.py` (STA‚ÜíSCA/SDA routing)
  - Execution tracking: `backend/app/agents/execution_tracker.py` (real-time monitoring with DB persistence)
- **Async-First:** All I/O (DB, LLM, external services) uses async functions with structured exception handling
- **LLM Provider:** Google Gemini 2.5 API as primary model for all agent reasoning
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph StateGraph with deterministic state machines, conditional edges, and node-level error recovery
- **RBAC:** New permission matrix to be codified in `core/rbac.py` (supersedes ad-hoc admin checks)
- **Observability:** Structured logging, execution tracking in `LangGraphExecution`/`NodeExecution`/`EdgeExecution` tables, real-time dashboard at `/admin/langgraph` (planned)

### Event-Centric Data Model

- **Primary Tables:** `events`, `messages`, `cases`, `resources`, `consents`, plus `users` refresh
- **Design Principles:**
  - Separation between raw user content (`messages`) and operational state (`cases`)
  - Deterministic hashing for user identifiers with differential privacy wrappers
  - Consent history recorded as append-only ledger with withdrawal workflows
- **Migration Plan:**
  1. Introduce new schema (revision scaffolded)
  2. Backfill via redaction-aware scripts in `backend/scripts/`
  3. Toggle STA/SCA features once parity checks pass

### Frontend Surfaces (Next.js 15 + Tailwind CSS 4)

- **Admin:** Service Desk (`/admin/(protected)/service-desk`) and Insights (`/admin/(protected)/insights`) will replace legacy analytics/intervention dashboards
- **User Chat:** Intent chips, CBT-informed responses, Consent banners, and Crisis alerts to be delivered through new components in `frontend/src/components/features/chat/`
- **Accessibility:** All new UI components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA and support keyboard navigation, ARIA labeling, and localization keys

### Automation & Integrations

- **LangGraph Orchestration:** All agent coordination and routing handled through LangGraph's stateful graph-based controller
- **Redis:** Session state, feature flags, and queue primitives for real-time triage alerts
- **Email/SMS Providers:** Pluggable connectors to be wrapped with consent checks before dispatch

---

## 4. Research & Clinical Governance

- **Methodology:** Design Science Research (DSR) framework with six iterative stages for prototype development and evaluation
- **Clinical Oversight:** Any automated recommendation requires explicit approval logging; Insights Agent dashboards must present uncertainty and evidence grading
- **Ethics & Privacy:**
  - Differential privacy (Œµ-Œ¥ budgets) and k-anonymity enforced at the Insights layer
  - Consent withdrawal honored by redaction policies and agent routing
  - No raw conversational content leaves secured storage; STA operates on redacted payloads
- **Success Criteria:** Crisis detection sensitivity/specificity (RQ1), orchestration reliability (RQ2), coaching quality per CBT rubric (RQ3), insights stability under privacy thresholds (RQ4)

## 7. Active Documentation Set

| Document | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `docs/refactor_plan.md` | Implementation to-do list for Safety Agent suite | Source of truth for code migration steps |
| `docs/DEPRECATED.md` | Index of retired documentation | Update when new specs go live |
| `docs/single-source-of-truth.md` | Lightweight overview for onboarding | Should mirror high-level narrative here |
| `docs/mental-health-ai-guidelines.md` | Ethics, crisis playbooks, cultural context | Remains valid and must be referenced in STA flows |
| `docs/development-workflow.md` | Collaboration & workflow guidance | Update once Service Desk surfaces land |

**Removed/Stubs:** `ai-integration-guide.md`, `api-integration-reference.md`, `authentication-system-update.md`, `cbt-conversational-flows.md`, and other legacy guides now contain deprecation notices only. Do not resurrect them‚Äîextend the Safety Agent docs instead.

---

## 8. Engineering Guardrails

- **Security:** Never hardcode secrets; rely on env vars and vault integrations. Enforce parameterised queries through SQLAlchemy.
- **Error Handling:** Fail closed for crisis workflows (STA must default to human review when uncertain).
- **Testing:** Add pytest + Playwright coverage around new STA/SCA flows before activation flags are set to true.
- **Accessibility:** All Service Desk and chat enhancements must meet a11y standards; include localization keys for user-facing strings.
- **Logging & Privacy:** Mask PII in logs; leverage the redaction utilities before writing payloads.

---

## 9. Compliance Snapshot

- **Consent Ledger:** Every therapeutic intervention, notification, or analytics query must reference consent scope; withdrawal triggers purge workflows.
- **Audit Trails:** Maintain immutable logs for triage escalations, coaching interventions, and analytics queries (required for clinical governance and research ethics).
- **Human Oversight:** Automated decisions require professional acknowledgment; SDA UI will enforce clinical sign-off before closing cases.
- **Data Residency:** PostgreSQL + Redis deployments must honor institutional policies (documented in deployment runbooks).

---

## 10. Key Contacts & Next Steps

- **Product Direction:** Align roadmap changes through `refactor_plan.md`; raise issues for scope adjustments.
- **Documentation Updates:** Mirror significant changes in both this file and `docs/single-source-of-truth.md`.
- **Open Questions:**
  1. Finalize naming/terminology for SDA SLAs and reporting lines
  2. Expand CBT module library with additional evidence-based interventions
  3. Confirm monitoring stack (Datadog vs OpenTelemetry native)

When completing any new feature, update this document and `docs/DEPRECATED.md` to reflect the canonical state. This file is the single reference all contributors and automation agents must consult before shipping changes.
